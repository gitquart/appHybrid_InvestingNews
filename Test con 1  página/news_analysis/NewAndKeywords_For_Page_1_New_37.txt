The Copper Price Mountain Crumbles
The combination of a more hawkish Fed and China’s decision to tap its strategic copper reserve has wrong-footed bullish investors
It’s too early to say copper prices have peaked for the cycle, but the next few months could get rocky.

Green energy plus inflation, infrastructure and easy money must equal a copper-price rally—at least that seems to have been the thinking of commodity investors, who had helped copper prices nearly double since late 2019.
Over the past week, that optimism has waned. The Federal Reserve, eyeing stubborn supply-chain and labor-market bottlenecks, has begun sending less dovish signals. And China, eyeing skyrocketing commodity costs, has elected to release part of its state copper reserves into the market. That one-two punch has taken copper prices off about 8% since mid-June.
What are investors to make of this? Can the rally really be over so early in the global economic recovery?
Given the likelihood of substantially more U.S. stimulus over the next few years and the hard tack toward green power and electric vehicles, it’s probably too early to say prices have peaked for the cycle. But the next few months could get rocky: Investors inclined to buy the dip might be wise to sit on their hands for now.
The bull case for copper is clear: Mining investment in 2020 was relatively tepid, while demand from copper-intensive green power and EVs seems certain to grow rapidly over the next few years, not only in the U.S. but in China and Europe. Easy money and a weak dollar also tend to feed copper prices.
