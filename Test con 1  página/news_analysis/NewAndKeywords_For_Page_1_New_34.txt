Europe’s oil and gas sector climbed on Tuesday as Brent crude-oil futures reached $75 a barrel, a milestone demonstrating the recovery in demand as economies reopen.
Integrated major oil companies Royal Dutch Shell RDSB, +2.77% and BP BP, +1.85% each rose 2%, and oil services firm TechnipFMC FTI, +1.81% rose 4%, as the Brent contract BRN00, -0.41% ended Monday at the highest level since Oct. 31, 2018.

The broader European stock market was trading in a tight range after a solid finish to U.S. trading on Monday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.26% slipping 0.2%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.33% ended Monday with a gain of 1.4%, its strongest daily gain in more than a month.
U.S. stock futures ES00, +0.34% were little moved ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony on the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic to a House committee. In prepared remarks, Powell said inflation will drop back toward its longer-run goals after transitory supply effects abate.
“Yesterday’s recovery across the Atlantic buoys European markets. With King Dollar taking a breather, and participants coming to terms with the fact that there is a significant lag between talking of tapering and the action of tapering itself, the path of least resistance for equities remains higher,” said Ryan Paisey, market commentator at PriapusIQ.
Prosus PRX, -3.18%, the technology investor, slipped 3%, after reporting a 45% rise in its core headline earnings per share for its March-ending fiscal year, which was in line with its forecast of core headline EPS growth between 41% and 48%.
Irish building materials company Kingspan KRX, +6.96% rose 5%, after saying first-half sales will be around €2.9 billion ($3.5 billion), up from first-half 2020 levels of €2.07 billion, and its trading profit will be in the region of €315 million, some 58% above comparable 2020 levels.
