after global benchmark brent crude briefly climbed above 75 a barrel for the first time in more than two years upside was capped after reuters and bloomberg both reported that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies a group known as opec had discussed a further relaxation of production curbs beginning in august reports that opec is already discussing an increase in its output from august ahead of its scheduled meeting on july 1 indicates that the demandsupply gap is already becoming an issue and that the alliance is working on a plan to tap that deficit said louise

group of producers already has an agreement in place to gradually increase oil production from may through july still strong physical demand continued to underpin crude analysts said the backwardation

commodities mark hulbert mark hulbert opinion gold is ready to rally and the fed and interest rates have nothing to do with it last updated june 22 2021 at 1101 a m et first published june 22 2021 at

referenced symbols gc00 0 20 listen to article 3 minutes dont be surprised if gold gc00 0 20 begins to rally the reason being that in the wake of golds plunge last week gold markettimers quickly turned bearish thats a positive sign according to contrarian analysis the gold timers bearish turn represents a big shift in sentiment on a number of occasions prior to last week gold timers were excessively bullish this meant that golds path of least resistance was down many missed this contrarian backdrop to last weeks plunge since there was a more immediate culprit the announcement from the federal reserves ratesetting committee that it might raise interest rates sooner than previously anticipated yet from a contrarian perspective the feds announcement was little more than the straw that broke the camels back consider the hulbert gold newsletter sentiment index hgnsi which reflects the average recommended gold market exposure level among a subset of several dozen shortterm gold timers this average now stands at minus 9 7 which means that the typical shortterm gold timer is allocating about 10 of his gold trading portfolio to going short a bet that gold will continue to decline that puts the hgnsi at the 14th percentile in a distribution of all readings since 2000 as recently as just a couple of weeks ago as you can see from the chart below the hgnsi stood at just shy of the 90th percentile of that distribution that 90th percentile is the threshold that some contrarians use to define the zone of excessive optimism thats why prior to last weeks fed meeting the sentiment winds were already blowing in the direction of lower prices as i alerted you in a may 9 column since then however the hgnsi has moved from close to the 90th percentile of the distribution to the 14th some may consider that already to be a big enough drop to support a rally other contrarians may insist on waiting until it drops into the bottom decile the threshold for which is minus 14 8 depending on golds action this week that could happen within a matter of days regardless the key to the extent and duration of golds subsequent rally will be a function of how quickly the gold timers turn bullish if they quickly jump on the bullish bandwagon then the rally will most likely fizzle out relatively quickly if instead they stubbornly remain bearish as that rally gains steam then it has the

dependent on oil production but the canadian oil industrys carbon emissions are among the worlds highest for every barrel of oil it pumps the canadian oil patch exemplifies the most vexing problem of the energy transition in the long term canada needs to cut its dependence on the energy sector that accounts for 10 of its economy as the world moves away from planetwarming fossil fuels in the short term canada needs to clean up the process of extracting oil to comply with national emissions targets the northern alberta oil sands spew three to five times the global average emissions per barrel of oil equivalent according to rystad energy because extracting crude from albertas gumbolike deposits of oil sand and clay requires additional energy just one of the nations five biggest oil companies suncor energy nysesu inc has a plan to cut emissions outright the producers say they need extensive government subsidies for carbon capture and other technologies such as small modular reactors smrs to meet climate goals there is not a dial on the wall where we can dial low carbon said cenovus energy nysecve chief executive alex pourbaix to decarbonize significantly takes capital massive quantities of capital over many years prime minister justin trudeau set in april a national goal to cut emissions 40 to 45 by 2030 from 2005 levels up from a previous goal of 30 pourbaix calls that goal extraordinarily ambitious although the united states is pledging a 5052 cut over the same period cenovus canadian natural nysecnq resources suncor imperial oil nyseimo and meg energy otcmegef this month formed an alliance to cut emissions but the producers are aiming at canadas 2050 netzero commitment and their interim goals fall short of trudeaus 2030 target a suncor spokesperson said the companies aim to reduce their emissions by onethird every 10 years the plan centers around government and industry funding a hub to capture carbon but it includes no details about capacity or cost suncor plans to cut absolute emissions 34 by 2030 even as it boosts oil production trudeaus own environment ministry projects oil sands emissions will climb to a record 95 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 from 83 million in 2019 albertas ministry of environment and parks said canadas new emissions target will require action across all parts of the economy and significant support from the federal government targets do not mean much without a realistic plan to achieve them spokesman paul hamnett said in an email the industry has reduced emissions per barrel 21 from 2009 to 2019 according to consultancy ihs markit but its absolute emissions have risen as output has grown we need to find pathways to reducing emissions in every major sector of the economy that produces

deploying renewables to power the oil sands carbon capture involves storing or reusing carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources so they do not enter the atmosphere the technology however has little commercial viability without subsidies ottawa and producers are arguing over the structure of a carbon capture tax credit producers say they face a disadvantage against u s competitors because projects that reinject carbon into the ground to extract oil called enhanced oil recovery do not qualify for credits ihs markit analyst kevin birn said the technology would allow producers to redeploy carbon and generate revenue by unlocking additional crude weve been at pains to make ottawa understand that this is quite new and expensive technology pourbaix said federal officials did not comment directly on carbon capture canadian natural resources is counting on carbon capture most to cut emissions but will not commit to matching the 2030 target until it better understands the governments incentives said president tim mckay suncor along with utility atco ltd is developing a multibilliondollar project in alberta to produce clean hydrogen and capture carbon but will only go ahead with government aid suncor ceo mark little said the project would cut emissions by 2 million tonnes annually or 0 3 of canadas total emissions would drop if the oil sands drew power from smrs instead of from natural gas but that technology is more expensive and would meet only a fraction of producers needs said ken darlington vicepresident of corporate development at usncpower while producers have cut carbon intensity by reducing steam use with solvents commercial deployment is slow because of the challenge of economically recovering solvent after using it mckay said the international energy agency in a report last month noted that cutting emissions to net zero by 2050 will be difficult unless the amount of carbon captured globally rises to 7 6 billion tonnes annually from a current 40 million tonnes its netzero not zero said suncors little some of the hardtodecarbonize industries we are going to have to offset emissions rather than eliminate them

recent news shipping disruption were doing our best but this is crippling home shipping news commodities report analysis oil energy world economy stock market news home oil energy oil companies news oil boom 2021 opec thinks u s shale has been tamed for awhile oil boom 2021 opec thinks u s shale has been tamed for awhile in oil companies news 22062021 we shouldnt let this last week pass without noting a couple of key stories related to the domestic u s oil and gas sector first was a decision by a federal judge in louisiana that will not be as impactful as some would like it to be and second was the conclusion reached by the participants in the opec export limitation agreement related to the rate of growth of u s shale oil production for the 2nd half of 2021 and through 2022 the june 15 ruling by louisiana federal court judge terry doughty that president joe bidens suspension of the federal oil and gas leasing program via executive fiat was an overreach of presidential authority was basically a foregone conclusion under any honest reading of the federal administrative procedures act and other governing statutes however that doesnt mean it will have any great substantive impact on the current moribund state of federal leasing or permitting for oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters when biden issued his order in january i noted that that particular public move was made mainly as a payback to an environmentalist lobby that played a big role in funding his campaign the real work of inhibiting energy activities in the federal province would be done behind the scenes through the bureaucracy and its administrative processes just as was the case during the obama presidency in an interview with reuters kathleen sgamma president of the western energy alliance affirmed the reality the industry faces in the bureaucracy we lived through the obama administration and they did a lot of things to constrain leasing and other activity on federal lands sgamma said and frankly they have the power to do so they do and they will indeed while judge doughtys order may force bidens interior secretary deb haaland to restart the process of auctioning these leases on a set schedule doi has full authority to determine which parcels of lands or waters will be offered in such lease sales this is not something anyone in the industry can control meanwhile as the likely proforma lease sales offering paltry and unattractive tracts are taking place bidens bureaucracy will work behind the scenes to slow the process just as it did during the obama years doughtys ruling is commendable because it is legally correct but no one should expect it to be hugely impactful in a truly substantive way representatives of the opec nations meanwhile held a technical meeting last week at which the group assessed the current growth rate of u s shale oil production and no doubt came away pleased with what they learned reuters reports that the group considered assessments by experts from entities like international energy agency argus media the u s energy information administration wood mackenzie ihs energy intelligence and energy aspects in order to arrive at a consensus estimate of how much additional oil u s shale producers would pour onto the global market over the next 18 months their consensus overall u s crude production will grow by a very modest 200000 barrels of oil per day bopd during 2021 and by between 500000 to 1 3 million bopd during 2022 that more robust range for 2022 assumes ongoing strong commodity prices will cause upstream operators to increase their capital budgets and refocus efforts on more drilling next year there is little doubt that the current set of facts on the ground favor rising oil prices for the foreseeable future the only apparent ways to change that dynamic would be the advent of another demandkilling global pandemic or another implosion of the opec agreement itself as took place in early march 2020 even given all of that however the high end of that projected range for 2022 would seem unlikely to come about u s producers are under tremendous pressure to forego big drilling budgets and focus on increased returns to investors and that is not going to change anytime soon add to that a current presidential administration that is only going to continue ramping up its efforts to inhibit the industrys growth in the u s even in the face of occasional adverse decisions by pesky federal judges and you have a situation in which even the low end of that projected growth range for 2022 could end up being seen as overlyoptimistic what it all means is that at least for the next 18 months the ability of opec to set and control the global price for crude oil is likely to be a much easer task than it has been at times in the past assuming of course the participating countries can hold that deal together source forbes seleccionar idioma con la tecnología de traductor de google share share guardar previous asia
