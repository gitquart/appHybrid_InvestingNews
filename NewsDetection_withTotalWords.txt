and centre it appears resulting in dry bulk owners enjoying unseasonably high profits and container shipping carriers and tonnage providers delivering record high profits in this piece bimco will take a look at some of the current records broken in the shipping industry worldwide pandemic fallout has strengthened asian dominance the swift recovery from the pandemic in china has seen its dry bulk imports rise to their highest levels ever boosted by infrastructure heavy stimulus and high grains demand causing a spike in the appetite for many dry bulk imports which have reached their highest levels ever this is certainly true for iron ore of which 471 8m tonnes source gacc have been imported in the first five months of the year a 26 5m tonne increase from the start of 2020 it is also 24 4m tonnes higher than the previous record for the first five months of the year which was set in 2019 when imports totaled 447 4m tonnes chinas record high demand for iron ore is fuelled by the countrys record high steel output and prices which reached 97 9m tonnes in april source nbs china in the first four months of the year chinese steel mills have pumped out 374 6m tonnes of steel a 15 8 increase from the same period in 2020 despite talk from the government about curbing annual production with the aim of reducing pollution high steel production in china is part of the wider picture with industrial production and manufacturing performing strongly at the start of the year boosting exports as goods hungry consumers in the developed world and especially in the us are buying chinese produced goods getting to europe is more expensive and unreliable than ever before although the strongest growth in exports from asia derives from trades to north america the far east to north europe trade has also experienced higher volumes however even more impressive are the freight rates on this route which have breached the usd 10000 per feu mark for the first time ever in fact they stand at usd 10544 per feu on 8 june 2021 source xeneta and are expected to rise even further when midmonth general rate increases gris are announced next week so far this year average far east to north europe freight rates have averaged usd 8224 per feu towering above the usd 1489 usd 2187 per feu that spot rates averaged on an annual basis between 2017 and 2020 this is despite volumes on this trade being up by only 1 0 in the first four months of 2021 compared to prepandemic 2019 an increase of just under 60000 teu the wider supply chain crunch as well as the global pressure on container shipping equipment shortages and disruptions such as the blockage of the suez canal and covid19 disruption at major chinese ports are behind the moderate increase long term contract rates have also risen to record high levels with carriers locking in long term contracts at usd 3836 per feu despite having to pay record high freight rates for some shippers the bigger worry is reliability the high demand for container shipping this year has meant more cargoes being rolled over and shippers finding it harder than ever to secure a spot for their boxes on the desired sailing while the shippers that are most valuable to carriers are escaping from these record high freight rates others are paying thousands of dollars in surcharges and even this is often not enough to secure space on already fully booked ships growth slowing but bauxite exports still record high in africa moving south and back into dry bulk one of africas largest exports is bauxite with guinea alone accounting for more than half of global seaborne bauxite exports in 2020 these too have been recordhigh since the start of the year reaching 29 2m tonnes in the first four months of the year slightly up from the previous record set in the first four months of 2020 of 29 0m tonnes so far this year 258 journeys have been started in guinea carrying bauxite 141 of which are capesize ships the largest buyer of guinean bauxite is china which has taken 19 7m tonnes and although this is an increase from 2020 it is not record high as guinean bauxite exports to china in the first four months of 2019 reached 20 2m tonnes despite the record high volume the growth rate so far this year is in fact the lowest it has been since this trade was established coming in at just 0 8 the growth rate has tapered off markedly since it peaked in 2017 when it grew by 64 8 in the first four months of that year compared with the same period in 2016 however the wider dry bulk industry is relatively isolated from both positive and negative developments on the dominant guinea to china trade as the majority of the volumes are carried on purposedbuilt and longterm leased ships after a slow start south america is exporting soya beans like never before across the south atlantic after a slow start to the year brazilian soya bean exports during april and may were the two strongest months on record in both months seaborne exports came in above 16 3m tonnes compared to the previous record of 14 8m tonnes set in april 2020 the slow start to the year means that the two months of record high imports has brought accumulated yearonyear growth in the first five months of the year up to only 5 3 although at 48 1m tonnes this is still the highest start to the year on record of these total exports around 70 are sent to china equivalent to 455 panamax loads of 75000 tonnes many records to be found in north america but one stands out a record high soya bean export season can also be found in the us when looking at this continent one record cannot be ignored as it is the primary driver behind the current highs of the container market north american container imports are up by 33 6 in the first four months of the year reaching 10 9m teu this is the first time they have exceeded 10m teu in the first third of the year accounting for almost 70 of total north american imports imports from the far east have grown by 45 0 from last year as consumer demand for goods made in the far east has reached record highs thanks to stayathome orders and government stimulus checks burning holes in consumers pockets even adjusting for the pandemic volumes on the far east to north america trade are up by an impressive 31 4 from the first four months of 2019 an increase of 1 8m teu this means an extra 120 fully loaded 15000 teu ships were needed during the first four months of this year compared to demand in 2019 on this trade alone a task not only for carriers to meet but also for ports and hinterland connections the latter two have proved particularly problematic in the us almost 60 of the extra teus transported globally in the first four months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2019 have been imported by the us the latter has seen total imports rise by 2 1m teu compared to the 3 6m teu that global volumes have increased by if you remove us imports from the picture global growth in container volumes from 2019 falls from 6 7 to 3 3 in the first four months of the year completing the round trip record amounts of air the combination of record high container imports and us exports still struggling to reach prepandemic levels the number of empty containers being sent on the backhaul transpacific trade is growing even faster than the already impressive growth in loaded imports compared to the first four months of 2019 the us west coast has exported 62 5 more empty containers than it did last year with 2 9m boxes being loaded onto ships the highest ever fourmonth period this is 1 8 times more than the number of loaded containers being exported these empty boxes are being returned to asia as fast as they can as asian exporters wait for them to return so that the cycle can start again back to asia to find one of the few tanker shipping records around unlike dry bulk and container shipping tanker shipping made its money last year and is still suffering the consequences of lower global oil demand however no trip around the shipping world is complete without tankers and few and far between some records can be found in fact back in china the worlds largest crude oil importer 2021 has been the strongest year for crude oil imports ever in the first five months of this year china imported 220 5m tonnes of crude oil source gacc compared to 215 6m tonnes imported in 2020 although a record the growth rate has slowed markedly from previous years when it was close to 10 instead compared to the first five months of 2020 chinese crude oil imports are up 2 3 and as the year progresses it is unlikely volumes will keep posting growth compared to 2020 due to the oil price war chinese imports of crude oil peaked in june and july 2020 above 50m tonnes per month but volumes this year are unlikely to reach those levels source bimco seleccionar idioma con la tecnolog√≠a de traductor de google tweet share share guardar tagged with tops previous advanced shipping trading weekly shipping

abandoned and hazardous vessels including the mv schiedyk a historic shipwreck leaking oil off the west coast of vancouver island yesterday the honourable bernadette jordan minister of fisheries oceans and the canadian coast guard announced the award of a 5 7 million emergency contract to resolve marine group of fort lauderdale florida to remove bulk fuel from the mv schiedyk the recent results of a technical assessment determined that immediate action to remove bulk fuel is necessary to protect nootka sound an area rich in natural beauty history culture wildlife and in the traditional territory of the mowachahtmuchalaht first nation in the fall of 2020 the shipwreck was confirmed to be the source of several reports of visible sheen on the surface of the water in zuciarte channel near bligh island in nootka sound since then the canadian coast guard bc ministry of environment and climate change strategy and the mowachahtmuchalaht first nation have been jointly leading a virtual incident command post to manage the response to reduce oil on the water and protect the environment the technical assessment found two tanks containing heavy fuel oil one tank with marine diesel oil and one tank with mixed oil product on board the vessel the amount of fuel is estimated to be approximately 147 cubic metres based on the total volume of the tanks however that amount may be less if the internal tank walls have been compressed resolve marine will use a process called hot tapping to reduce the volume of fuel in the tanks this process involves drilling a hole in the fuel tank from the outside attaching a drainage valve and pumping the fuel out of the tank through a hose attached to the valve the hottap method has been used successfully on shipwrecks for many years including in the case of the manolis l in atlantic canada in 2018 given the nature of the operation there is a small risk of a larger release of oil canadian coast guard environmental

beauty history culture wildlife and in the traditional territory of the mowachahtmuchalaht first nation in the fall of 2020 the shipwreck was confirmed to be the source of several reports of visible

the tanks this process involves drilling a hole in the fuel tank from the outside attaching a drainage valve and pumping the fuel out of the tank through a hose attached to the valve the hottap method has been used successfully on shipwrecks for many years including in the case of the manolis l in atlantic canada in 2018 given the nature of the operation there is a small risk of a larger release of oil canadian coast guard environmental response crews are prepared to address this should it arise and will continue to be onsite and ready to respond if necessary work is scheduled to begin in

doubled exxon holdings in the permian basin that spans west texas and new mexico the permians new mexico portion is among exxons priorities with a goal to boost shale output to 700000 bpd by 2025 exxons average liquids output over a wells first 12 months fell to 521 barrels per day bpd in 2019 in its delaware basin holdings in new mexico down from an average of 635 bpd in 2018 according to ihs markit data compiled by the institute for energy economics and financial analysis ieefa it dropped to 6th from first on a perwell production basis among a group of large publiclytrade producers the data showed behind occidental petroleum eog resources and others full data for 2020 is not yet available and many wells across the basin were shutin due to the pandemic but initial findings of data

oil traders recruited during past expansion sources exclusiveexxon losing veteran oil traders recruited during past expansion sources in oil companies news 12062021 exxon mobil corp has lost two veteran crude oil traders from its u s energy trading group and a third is leaving its british unit according to people familiar with the matter in a continued exodus of top talent from the oil major exxon last year reversed course on an expansion of its oil and petroleum products trading as fuel demand tumbled during the pandemic the company suffered a 22 4 billion loss in 2020 leading to deep job and cost cuts across the business veteran oil traders michael paradise and adam buller both of whom joined exxon in 2019 after lengthy careers elsewhere resigned last week the people said paul butcher an oil trader in britain plans to leave in september another person familiar with the operation said butcher was recruited in 2018 as a north sea crude oil trader and adviser on accounting for transactions to its leatherhead unit near london he had previously worked for bp plc glencore plc and vitol sa exxon declined to comment on the departures citing personnel matters were pleased with our progress over the past couple of years to grow our team and capabilities said spokesman casey norton exxons scale and reach give our trading teams a broad footprint and unique knowledge and insights that can generate value for shareholders veteran departures paradise was a highly regarded crude oil trader who joined exxon from noble group and was previously director of crude oil trading at citigroup inc and bnp paribas buller joined exxon in late 2019 after trading oil for petrolama energy canada and spains repsol sa he earlier was director of international oil trading at bg group both will join pilot flying j a closelyheld knoxville tennessee company that operates retail refueling centers in north america it has expanded into crude marketing fuel transportation and storage and has is own trading unit run by a former noble group executive a spokesperson at pilot flying j declined to comment exxon recruited paradise buller and a cadre of experienced traders from rivals and international oil trading firms hoping to replicate bp and royal dutch shells success in trading it initially saw the expansion as a way to profit from its knowledge of customer demand oil production pipelines and fuel shipping bp and shells trading groups took advantage of last years market volatility to generate enormous trading profits buying oil as it fell below 20 a barrel last spring they sold it at higher prices for future delivery posting multibilliondollar profits for the year but exxon pulled back trading as the market dropped and sought to preserve its capital to sustain its shareholder dividend while rivals cut their payouts exxon systematically avoided risk by pulling most of the capital needed for speculative trades subjecting most trades to highlevel management review and limiting some traders to working only with longtime exxon customers it later laid off some staff and offered early retirement packages to others reuters reported exxon does not separately report

course iea oil market recovery stays the course in oil companies news 12062021 the iea oil market report omr is one of the worlds most authoritative and timely sources of data forecasts and analysis on the global oil market including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply demand inventories prices and refining activity as well as oil trade for iea and selected noniea countries highlights global oil demand is set to return to prepandemic levels by the end of 2022 rising 5 4 mbd in 2021 and a further 3 1 mbd next year the oecd accounts for 1 3 mbd of 2022 growth while nonoecd countries contribute 1 8 mbd jet and kerosene demand will see the largest increase 1 5 mbd yoy followed by gasoline 660 kbd yoy and gasoildiesel 520 kbd yoy world oil supply is expected to grow at a faster rate in 2022 with the us driving gains of 1 6 mbd from producers outside the opec alliance that leaves room for opec to boost crude oil production by 1 4 mbd above its july 2021march 2022 target to meet demand growth in 2021 oil output from nonopec is set to rise 710 kbd while total oil supply from opec could increase by 800 kbd if the bloc sticks with its existing policy global refinery throughput in 2021 is expected to recover half of the 7 4 mbd fall in 2020 lagging behind demand growth for refined products as surplus inventories are drawn down in 2022 refining activity is forecast to increase by 2 4 mbd 3 8 mbd of new capacity coming on line over 202122 will be partially offset by 2 3 mbd of announced closures or conversions to biorefineries oecd industry stocks held relatively steady in april at 2 926 mb but fell 1 6 mb below the precovid 201519 average for the first time in more than a year may preliminary data for the us europe and japan show that industry stocks rose by a combined 17 2 mb crude oil held in shortterm floating storage declined by 6 8 mb to 99 4 mb in may its lowest since february 2020 crude prices rose on bullish oil fundamentals and financial markets over the past month while backwardation steepened on both benchmark crude futures contracts reflecting anticipation of tighter markets ahead north sea dated rose 3 95bbl in may to 68 54bbl and reached 69 84bbl in the first week of june tanker freight costs remained weak overall during may recovery stays the course our first detailed look at 2022 balances confirms earlier expectations that opec needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied global oil demand will continue to recover and in the absence of further policy changes by end2022 reach 100 6 mbd nonopec production is also set to rise but gains are nowhere near the levels needed to prevent further stockdraws in april oecd total industry stocks fell 61 3 mb below their 20162020 average the pace at which the opec cuts can be unwound will depend not only on the success in containing the spread of the virus and demand growth but also the timing of the eventual return of iranian barrels to the market following a record decline of 8 6 mbd in 2020 global oil demand is forecast to rebound by 5 4 mbd in 2021 and a further 3 1 mbd next year to average 99 5 mbd by end2022 demand should surpass precovid levels the recovery will be uneven not only amongst regions but across sectors and products while the end of the pandemic is in sight in advanced economies slow vaccine distribution could still jeopardise the recovery in nonoecd countries the aviation sector will be the slowest to recover as some travel restrictions are likely to stay in place until the pandemic is brought firmly under control gasoline demand is also expected to lag precovid levels as continued teleworking practices and a rising share of electric and more efficient vehicles provide an offset to increased mobility petrochemicals will be boosted by robust demand for plastics while global trade supports bunker demand meeting the expected demand growth is unlikely to be a problem even after boosting oil production by around 2 mbd over the mayjuly period opec will have 6 9 mbd of effective spare capacity if sanctions on iran are lifted an additional 1 4 mbd could be brought to market in relatively short order as for those producers outside the alliance output growth is set to accelerate from 700 kbd in 2021 to 1 6 mbd next year the us leads 2022 gains adding more than 900 kbd to total supply followed by canada brazil and norway that leaves nonopec output well above 2019 levels by contrast even if opec producers were to fill the gap created by demand growth the blocs output would still be more than 2 mbd below the 2019 average the refining sector meanwhile is expected to remain under pressure in 2022 demand for refined products will still be below 2017 levels following net capacity additions of 3 3 mbd over the 201720 period a further 1 5 mbd of new net crude distillation capacity will come online in 202122 this means that global average utilisation rates reach 78 limiting any rebound in refinery margins from the depressed 202021 levels the forecast also highlights the challenges outlined in the ieas recently released net zero by 2050 a roadmap for the global

trading result as markets recover trafigura reports exceptional oil trading result as markets recover in oil companies news 12062021 trafigura one of the worlds biggest independent commodity traders saw its oil trading volumes rise 14 during the six months to march 31 compared with 2020 amid renewed market volatility as the world emerges from the impact of the pandemic the singaporebased trader said crude and oil products volumes averaged 6 4 million bd in its firsthalf financial year up from an average of 5 6 million bd in the 2020 fiscal year this was an exceptional first half for our trading divisions by any standards trafigura chief financial officer christophe salmon said in a june 10 statement the energy markets saw substantial volatility as the global economy started to recover from the effects of the pandemic as cold weather in the northern hemisphere impacted energy demand and in response to other events such as the temporary closure of the suez canal trafiguras higher trading volumes over the period sees it narrow the gap to top independent trader rival vitol which saw traded oil volumes slip 11 in 2020 to 7 1 million bd the singaporebased trader said its oil division reported a gross profit of 2 78 billion for the first half of the 2021 fiscal year making up 65 of gross earnings alongside metals and minerals in december the trading house said it had benefitted from a surge in geographical trade arbitrage opportunities during 2020 which were amplified by the uneven regional impact of the pandemic on demand and trade flows brent crude prices have recovered by 78 over the sixmonth period to march 31 to hit twoyear highs of over 72b as the global economy rebounds from swingeing pandemic lockdowns upbeat on global recovery the company said it also saw a strengthening of its overall financial position in the last six months with increased bank liquidity on favorable terms enabling it to handle larger trade flows looking ahead trafigura said it sees a continued strong performance from trading operations this year helped by shifts in supply and demand in global commodity markets and the world recovery from the pandemic however it noted that it does not expect secondhalf fiscal results to match the firsthalf performance the energy transition that is now gaining momentum is already having a profound impact on our business in driving seismic changes in fossil fuel markets as well as fueling exponential increases in demand for certain nonferrous metals salmon said trafigura said it sees strong macroeconomic tailwinds supporting the global economy this year including expansive monetary policy fiscal stimulus pentup demand and record savings which paint a picture of a resilient and strong growth trajectory the company reported a record net profit for the period of 2 1 billion from 542 million for the first half of 2020 as a result of increased trading volumes and higher volatility source platts seleccionar idioma con la

just above the fiveyear average for the second consecutive week but smaller builds due to greater power demand look likely for the rest of the month providing support to henry hub futures storage inventories increased 98 bcf to 2 411 tcf for the weekended june 4 the us energy information administration reported june 10 the build was more than the 95 bcf addition expected by an sp global platts

the fiveyear average of 2 466 tcf the injection matched the 98 bcf added to inventories for the week prior monthtodate total feedgas deliveries have averaged 10 1 bcfd slightly below the june forecast of 10 4 bcfd according to sp global platts analytics when available us lng export facilities are expected to run at full utilization about 11 bcfd as netbacks into jkm and ttf remain wide open at

appears to be fully underway during the week in progress with power burn demand rising by more than 7 bcfd on the week the effects of that were dulled by a 2 4 bcfd drop in residential and commercial demand and a 1 7 bcfd drop in lng feedgas demand thought to be linked to annual maintenance taking place at certain liquefaction plants on the gulf coast amid fairly substantial changes in the various demand sectors total us demand has seen a net increase of about 2 6 bcfd week over week supply on the other hand has been mostly stagnant with nearly all of the weeks 900 mmcfd increase in total us

bcf temperatures in the east and midwest climbed by more than 13 degrees degrees week over week pushing up local power burn demand and cutting into the volumes available for storage the tighter

2021 230 pm cdt norway is betting on offshore wind hydrogen and electrification to meet its commitment under the paris agreement but its oil and gas sector will continue to play a major role in longterm job creation economic growth prospects and value for the country the government said on friday norway western europes largest oil producer is preparing to face the energy transition yet it believes that it can develop its petroleum resources to deliver lowemission production within its climate policy the governments white paper putting energy to work showed retaining expertise and technologies in the oil and gas sector is also vital for the development of new industries and technologies such as carbon capture and storage offshore wind and hydrogen minister of petroleum and energy tina bru said in a statement the main goal of the governments petroleum policy to facilitate profitable production in the oil and gas industry in a long term perspective is firmly in place she added according to the norwegian government the domestic oil and gas industry currently faces two major challengesmaturing oilfields and increasing demands for lower emissions the petroleum sector will remain a significant factor in the norwegian economy in the years to come although not on the same scale as today the government will facilitate longterm economic growth in the petroleum industry

investing in oil and gas since the international energy agency suggested in a report last month that the world wouldnt need new investment in fossil fuels ever if it wants to achieve netzero in 2050 the norwegian oil and gas association has also commented on the iea report saying that it does not share the assumption that opec members alone should account for more than half of oil and gas production for the world market in a 2050 perspective if demand does not decline as rapidly as the iea assumes in its scenario and the supply side is simultaneously choked off global energy provision

home markets market extra market extra how oil soaring to 100 a barrel could be bad for this boombust sector and the economy last updated june 11 2021 at 404 p m et first published june 11 2021 at 329 p m et by joy wiltermuth 1 if demand returns to 100 million barrels a day that feels very ominous to me debt pro warns marketwatch photo illustrationistockphoto email icon facebook icon twitter icon linkedin icon flipboard icon print icon resize icon referenced symbols cl00 0 70 cln21 0 70 spx 0 19 listen to article 6 minutes oil companies often find religion in the wake of a boomandbust cycle including after last year when crude prices crashed into negative territory for the first time on record but with oil prices recently back near 70 a barrel and some analysts speculating on the return to 100 during the covid recovery investors fear wildcatting and other risky financial behavior by energy companies will make a comeback we lost a lot of our weakest companies andrew feltus codirector of highyields at amundi us said of the ripple effects of oil futures going negative in april 2020 as demand collapsed with the first waves of covid outbreaks and oilproducing giants saudi arabia and russia waged an ugly price war no one can exist in that type of situation for long feltus told marketwatch if you dont have enough money to survive you are gone company executives took those lessons for the u s energy complex to heart after pandemic shutdowns depressed oil demand and for a period led to higher borrowing costs in the sector it also led to greater prudence but theres no telling how long the latest stretch of good energy company behavior actions preferred by their riskwary lenders and investors will last thats particularly true if prices shoot dramatically higher and breach 100 a barrel as feltus said 50 oil is the price we want 70 is just gravy with 100 oil they will be dancing in the streets of dallas prices for u s benchmark west texas intermediate crude for july delivery cl00 0 70 cln21 0 70 were near 70 75 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange on friday and headed for a weekly rise of about 1 7 this chart tracks the plunge and recovery of wti since april 2020 with the red line highlighting the stretch in which prices stayed below 40 a barrel 40 oil often brings pain factset keeping up prices saw a boost friday from the international energy agency which said global oil demand would return to precovid19 pandemic levels by the end of next year what the news means for you and your money understand how todays business practices market dynamics tax policies and more impact you with realtime news and analysis from marketwatch subscribe now 50 off 1 year iea also forecast demand to reach 100 6 million barrels a day by the end of 2022 while indicating that producers will need to boost output to keep up with demand read heres what sparked the latest talk over 100 oil prices the changing landscape for oil including the increased focus by investors and the biden administration on encouraging more environmentally sustainable practices comes as a u s rig count has hovered at about half of precovid levels said steve repoff portfolio manager at gwk investment read climatechange pressure builds on big oil after activist wins exxon board seats court ruling hits shell but thats not without its own set of concerns as vaccinations in the u s increase demand for oil climbs and the economy opens more broadly including over the summer and the postcovid travel season could turn costly for drivers it seems these companies for now have

video by defred folts iii managing partner chief investment strategist and eric biegeleisen cfa managing director research portfolio manager equities u s equities the u s equity market outlook is a bit more neutral currently given the tug of war between the positive impact of the global economic rebound and concerns about whether robust economic growth will prove to be inflationary thereby prompting the federal reserve to withdraw its extraordinary monetary policy support sooner than anticipated at the same time equity markets in general including the u s are continuing to benefit from accommodative central bank policies narrowing credit spreads and steepening yield curves india equities our model research currently finds the india equity market to be attractive current struggles with the pandemic and the upcoming elections should encourage highly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies for an extended period and leave room for economic improvement once vaccinations ramp up additional factors that enhance the prospects for the indian equity market include the potential for future economic growth as indicated by a steepening yield curve measure a benign interest rate environment and favorable longterm demographic trends japanese equities remain attractive and should continue to benefit from narrowing high yield spreads steepening yield curve measures and positive investor psychology in addition the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic should benefit many of japans largest corporations since they tend to export their products all over the world including into the u s european equities european companies should also continue to benefit from the sustained and extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus required to support the region because of a slower recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and inconsistent progress on vaccinations in addition a continued rotation from growth equities to the stocks of more cyclical companies that benefit more from the ongoing global economic recovery should continue to be positive for europe early signs of increasing inflation in the eurozone will need to be monitored china equities the model outlook for chinese equities is currently neutral while chinese companies benefit from accommodative monetary policies as reflected in the favorable price momentum weve witnessed recently the recent uptick in u s inflation elevated u s treasury yields and strengthening of the chinese yuan neutralizes the overall outlook in the shortterm fixed income the bond market has been relatively stable recently even in the face of economic data indicating signs of inflationary pressures throughout the economy as the u s emerges from the pandemic u s treasuries represent an unattractive riskreturn tradeoff at current yields as they continue to yield less than the markets expected inflation rate across nearly all maturities caused in part by investors searching for yield expectations for economic recovery and the feds continued tacit support of the credit markets corporate bonds credit spreads the difference between highyield and investmentgrade bond yields have continued to narrow and junk bond issuance remains strong however with record amounts of corporate debt outstanding and with historically low yields for highyield bonds there is a heightened risk that any accident in the financial markets could cause credit spreads to widen abruptly real assets gold has now recovered most of the declines that it suffered earlier in 2021 and continues to be supported by negative real interest rates nominal rates minus inflation expectations gold could also benefit from future inflation prospects particularly if the fed maintains its stance on inflation being transient and sticking to its stated timeline on interest rate policy and bondbuying programs commodities remain attractive due to the longstanding relative undervaluation of real assets and the prospect of a robust global economic recovery in the second half of 2021 as well as the prospects for a weaker u s dollar other factors positively impacting real assets include appreciation of the chinese yuan narrowing credit
