Norway Isn’t Giving Up On New Oil Development

Norway is betting on offshore wind, hydrogen, and electrification to meet its commitment under the Paris Agreement, but its oil and gas sector will continue to play a major role in long-term job creation, economic growth prospects, and value for the country, the government said on Friday.
Norway, Western Europe’s largest oil producer, is preparing to face the energy transition, yet it believes that it can develop its petroleum resources to deliver low-emission production within its climate policy, the government’s White Paper ‘Putting Energy to Work’ showed.
“Retaining expertise and technologies in the oil and gas sector is also vital for the development of new industries and technologies such as carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and hydrogen,” Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Tina Bru, said in a statement.
“The main goal of the government’s petroleum policy - to facilitate profitable production in the oil and gas industry in a long term perspective - is firmly in place,” she added.
According to the Norwegian government, the domestic oil and gas industry currently faces two major challenges—maturing oilfields and increasing demands for lower emissions.
“The petroleum sector will remain a significant factor in the Norwegian economy in the years to come, although not on the same scale as today. The government will facilitate long-term economic growth in the petroleum industry within the framework of our climate policy and our commitments under the Paris Agreement,” the government said.
Norway has become yet another oil-producing country that has said it would not stop investing in oil and gas since the International Energy Agency suggested in a report last month that the world wouldn’t need new investment in fossil fuels ever if it wants to achieve net-zero in 2050.
The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association has also commented on the IEA report, saying that it “does not share the assumption that Opec members alone should account for more than half of oil and gas production for the world market in a 2050 perspective. If demand does not decline as rapidly as the IEA assumes in its scenario, and the supply side is simultaneously choked off, global energy provision could be threatened and lead to very high energy prices.”

Iran Says It's Ready For Speedy Oil Output Hike
Norway Isn’t Giving Up On New Oil Development

Norway is betting on offshore wind, hydrogen, and electrification to meet its commitment under the Paris Agreement, but its oil and gas sector will continue to play a major role in long-term job creation, economic growth prospects, and value for the country, the government said on Friday.
Norway, Western Europe’s largest oil producer, is preparing to face the energy transition, yet it believes that it can develop its petroleum resources to deliver low-emission production within its climate policy, the government’s White Paper ‘Putting Energy to Work’ showed.
“Retaining expertise and technologies in the oil and gas sector is also vital for the development of new industries and technologies such as carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and hydrogen,” Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Tina Bru, said in a statement.
“The main goal of the government’s petroleum policy - to facilitate profitable production in the oil and gas industry in a long term perspective - is firmly in place,” she added.
According to the Norwegian government, the domestic oil and gas industry currently faces two major challenges—maturing oilfields and increasing demands for lower emissions.
“The petroleum sector will remain a significant factor in the Norwegian economy in the years to come, although not on the same scale as today. The government will facilitate long-term economic growth in the petroleum industry within the framework of our climate policy and our commitments under the Paris Agreement,” the government said.
Norway has become yet another oil-producing country that has said it would not stop investing in oil and gas since the International Energy Agency suggested in a report last month that the world wouldn’t need new investment in fossil fuels ever if it wants to achieve net-zero in 2050.
The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association has also commented on the IEA report, saying that it “does not share the assumption that Opec members alone should account for more than half of oil and gas production for the world market in a 2050 perspective. If demand does not decline as rapidly as the IEA assumes in its scenario, and the supply side is simultaneously choked off, global energy provision could be threatened and lead to very high energy prices.”

Oil companies often find religion in the wake of a boom-and-bust cycle, including after last year when crude prices crashed into negative territory for the first time on record.
But with oil prices recently back near $70 a barrel, and some analysts speculating on the return to $100 during the COVID recovery, investors fear wildcatting and other risky financial behavior by energy companies will make a comeback.
“We lost a lot of our weakest companies,” Andrew Feltus, co-director of high-yields at Amundi US, said of the ripple effects of oil futures going negative in April 2020 as demand collapsed with the first waves of COVID outbreaks and oil-producing giants Saudi Arabia and Russia waged an ugly price war.
“No one can exist in that type of situation for long,” Feltus told MarketWatch. “If you don’t have enough money to survive, you are gone.”
Company executives took those lessons for the U.S. energy complex to heart after pandemic shutdowns depressed oil demand and, for a period, led to higher borrowing costs in the sector. It also led to greater prudence.
But there’s no telling how long the latest stretch of “good” energy company behavior — actions preferred by their risk-wary lenders and investors — will last. That’s particularly true if prices shoot dramatically higher and breach $100 a barrel.
As Feltus said, “$50 oil is the price we want. $70 is just gravy. With $100 oil, they will be dancing in the streets of Dallas.”
Prices for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL00, +0.75% CLN21, +0.75% were near $70.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday and headed for a weekly rise of about 1.7%.
This chart tracks the plunge and recovery of WTI since April 2020, with the red line highlighting the stretch in which prices stayed below $40 a barrel.

Keeping up?
Prices saw a boost Friday from the International Energy Agency, which said global oil demand would return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by the end of next year.

IEA also forecast demand to reach 100.6 million barrels a day by the end of 2022, while indicating that producers will need to boost output to keep up with demand.

The changing landscape for oil, including the increased focus by investors and the Biden administration on encouraging more environmentally sustainable practices, comes as a U.S. rig count has hovered at about half of pre-COVID levels, said Steve Repoff, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment.

But that’s not without its own set of concerns as vaccinations in the U.S. increase, demand for oil climbs and the economy opens more broadly, including over the summer. And the post-COVID travel season could turn costly for drivers.
“It seems these companies, for now, have demonstrated capital discipline, in a sector notorious for being unable to display capital discipline,” Repoff told MarketWatch.
“But if we see demand of 100 million barrels a day return, that feels very ominous to me,” he said, adding that it’s unclear if U.S. producers will struggle to ramp up production.
“What if all the best shale, in aggregate, has been drilled already?” Repoff said, while explaining how higher oil prices can be good for the oil industry, but also deflationary, even as the Federal Reserve expects the cost of living in America to overshoot its 2% inflation target for awhile during the recovery.
“When applied to the broader economy, it’s effectively a tax on businesses and consumers, and at the systemwide level is ultimately deflationary,” Repoff said of booming oil prices.
$100 oil is a mixed blessing
It took no time for COVID shutdowns to rattle the booming U.S. high-yield bond market last year, with defaults quickly jumping to a 10-year high of almost 5% and helping prompt the Fed to launch its first program ever of buying up corporate debt.
Recently, as the sector has recovered, including with yields on the overall ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index plunging near all-time lows of 4.1%, the Fed said it would sell its remaining corporate bond exposure.

As a result, the so-called “junk-bond” market ended up with its highest-quality mix of companies by credit rating in at least a decade, but perhaps even 20 to 30 years, according to Feltus at Amundi, even while energy remains the sector’s biggest exposure at about 13% of its benchmark high-yield index. That compares with a roughly 3% slice for energy in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.19%, leaving investors in it grappling with swings in exposure.
‘$50 oil is the price we want. $70 is just gravy. With $100 oil, they will be dancing in the streets of Dallas.’
— Andrew Feltus at Amundi US
While energy has long been a key part of the U.S. high-yield market, oil booms haven’t always been great over the long run for bond investors who help finance the sector.
“History says it depends on what else is going on in the market,” said Marty Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, particularly when oil prices rise and fall around times of economic crisis.
Starting in the summer of 2007, oil prices quickly advanced over eight months from $70.68 on June 29 to $101.84 on Feb. 29, 2008. But when Fridson looked at how the energy component fared over that stretch, it outperformed the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, returning 3.88% compared to negative 3.32%.
Then, in the more protracted recovery phase, oil went from $70.61 on Sept. 30, 2009, to $96.07 on Feb. 28, 2011, while energy underperformed the index, 23.57% to 26.38%.
Amundi’s Feltus also pointed out that companies “got religion for like six to 12 months of discipline,” after each recent oil bust. “This time breaks the record. But we can’t let up the pressure.”

“It seems these companies, for now, have demonstrated capital discipline, in a sector notorious for being unable to display capital discipline,” Repoff told MarketWatch.
“But if we see demand of 100 million barrels a day return, that feels very ominous to me,” he said, adding that it’s unclear if U.S. producers will struggle to ramp up production.
“What if all the best shale, in aggregate, has been drilled already?” Repoff said, while explaining how higher oil prices can be good for the oil industry, but also deflationary, even as the Federal Reserve expects the cost of living in America to overshoot its 2% inflation target for awhile during the recovery.
“When applied to the broader economy, it’s effectively a tax on businesses and consumers, and at the systemwide level is ultimately deflationary,” Repoff said of booming oil prices.
$100 oil is a mixed blessing
It took no time for COVID shutdowns to rattle the booming U.S. high-yield bond market last year, with defaults quickly jumping to a 10-year high of almost 5% and helping prompt the Fed to launch its first program ever of buying up corporate debt.
Recently, as the sector has recovered, including with yields on the overall ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index plunging near all-time lows of 4.1%, the Fed said it would sell its remaining corporate bond exposure.
See: Is the Fed ‘tightening cycle’ already happening?
As a result, the so-called “junk-bond” market ended up with its highest-quality mix of companies by credit rating in at least a decade, but perhaps even 20 to 30 years, according to Feltus at Amundi, even while energy remains the sector’s biggest exposure at about 13% of its benchmark high-yield index. That compares with a roughly 3% slice for energy in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.19%, leaving investors in it grappling with swings in exposure.
‘$50 oil is the price we want. $70 is just gravy. With $100 oil, they will be dancing in the streets of Dallas.’
— Andrew Feltus at Amundi US
While energy has long been a key part of the U.S. high-yield market, oil booms haven’t always been great over the long run for bond investors who help finance the sector.
“History says it depends on what else is going on in the market,” said Marty Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, particularly when oil prices rise and fall around times of economic crisis.
Starting in the summer of 2007, oil prices quickly advanced over eight months from $70.68 on June 29 to $101.84 on Feb. 29, 2008. But when Fridson looked at how the energy component fared over that stretch, it outperformed the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, returning 3.88% compared to negative 3.32%.
Then, in the more protracted recovery phase, oil went from $70.61 on Sept. 30, 2009, to $96.07 on Feb. 28, 2011, while energy underperformed the index, 23.57% to 26.38%.
Amundi’s Feltus also pointed out that companies “got religion for like six to 12 months of discipline,” after each recent oil bust. “This time breaks the record. But we can’t let up the pressure.”

Oil prices climbed Friday, tallying a third-weekly gain to finish at a more than two-year high, as the International Energy Agency said it expects global oil demand to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by the end of next year.
Producers will need to increase output to keep up with demand recovery, the Paris-based energy agency said in its June oil market report. It forecasts demand to rise in 2021 before growing at a faster rate next year, reaching 100.6 million barrels a day (mb/d) by the end of 2022.
The market “can’t ignore the clearly bullish signal” from the IEA report, in which the IEA calls for more oil to be produced by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, “to meet the oil demand recovery of 2022,” said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.
“Supply conservatism by OPEC+ has supported oil prices since last year and is the reason prices have now reached such highs,” she said in a daily note. “There is definitely room for OPEC+ to boost output from the second part of this year and as long as this doesn’t happen, there is a definite upside for oil prices.”
On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery  CL00, +0.75% CLN21, +0.75% rose 62 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $70.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange — the highest since October 2018.
Based on the front-month contracts, WTI prices saw a weekly rise of nearly 1.9%, their third weekly climb in a row, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

August Brent crude, the global benchmark BRN00, -0.11% BRNQ21, -0.11%,  added 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $72.69 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Brent settled at the highest since April 2019 and scored weekly climb of 1.1%.
The IEA said that following the record decline of 8.6 mb/d in 2020, global oil demand was now forecast to rebound by 5.4 mb/d in 2021 and a further 3.1 mb/d in 2022. “The recovery will be uneven not only among regions but across sectors and products. While the end of the pandemic is in sight in advanced economies, slow vaccine distribution could still jeopardize the recovery in non-OECD countries,” it said.
The IEA also said there was scope for OPEC+ to boost production by 1.4 mb/d above its July 2021 to March 2022 target. “Our first detailed look at 2022 balances confirms earlier expectations that OPEC+ needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied.”

Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to keep its current plan to gradually increase oil production through July in place, sending crude oil futures to their highest settlements in more than two years. It’s next meeting will be held July 1.
There were still a number of factors that could affect the speed at which OPEC+ can reverse its pandemic-induced production cuts, the IEA said. “The pace at which the OPEC+ cuts can be unwound will depend not only on the success in containing the spread of the virus and demand growth but also the timing of the eventual return of Iranian barrels to the market.”
The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a weekly jump in U.S. gasoline inventories and a fall in implied demand for the fuel.
“The recent decline in demand could revert higher as the summer driving season progresses and as rising economic activity supports distillate demand,” Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit, told MarketWatch. “The recovery in the U.S. economy is still expected to drive global growth overall.”
“U.S. crude stocks are below normal at a four-month low, and could tighten further as demand is expected to increase through the summer,” he said.
Data from Baker Hughes BKR, +1.57% on Friday suggested that U.S. production may soon rise, as the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil was up by six at 365 this week.
Meanwhile, “Iran is a wildcard, depending on the outcome of nuclear talks,” said Steeves. “If successful, another one million bpd in exports could result, and OPEC would need to respond to that.”
Among the petroleum products traded on Nymex Friday, July gasoline RBN21, -1.32% fell 1.2% to nearly $2.19 a gallon, for a weekly decline of almost 1.2%, while July heating oil HON21, -1.24% lost 1.1% to $2.12 a gallon, ending just 0.04% higher than the week-ago finish.
July natural gas NGN21, +4.35%, however, rose 4.7%, to settle at nearly $3.30 per million British thermal units, with prices up 6.4% for the week. That was the highest finish since Oct. 30 of last year.
The EIA on Thursday reported an increase of 98 billion cubic feet in last week’s U.S. supplies of the fuel, which came in above the first-year average for the period, said Christin Redmond, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.
But “with record high temperatures expected for some parts of the Western U.S. over the next couple of weeks, that trend may reverse, as higher cooling demand drives higher demand for gas from power generators,” she said in a market update.
Barbara Kollmeyer in Madrid contributed to this report.

Oil prices climbed Friday, tallying a third-weekly gain to finish at a more than two-year high, as the International Energy Agency said it expects global oil demand to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by the end of next year.
Producers will need to increase output to keep up with demand recovery, the Paris-based energy agency said in its June oil market report. It forecasts demand to rise in 2021 before growing at a faster rate next year, reaching 100.6 million barrels a day (mb/d) by the end of 2022.
The market “can’t ignore the clearly bullish signal” from the IEA report, in which the IEA calls for more oil to be produced by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, “to meet the oil demand recovery of 2022,” said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.
“Supply conservatism by OPEC+ has supported oil prices since last year and is the reason prices have now reached such highs,” she said in a daily note. “There is definitely room for OPEC+ to boost output from the second part of this year and as long as this doesn’t happen, there is a definite upside for oil prices.”
On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery  CL00, +0.75% CLN21, 0.74% rose 62 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $70.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange — the highest since October 2018.
Based on the front-month contracts, WTI prices saw a weekly rise of nearly 1.9%, their third weekly climb in a row, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

August Brent crude, the global benchmark BRN00, -0.11% BRNQ21, -0.11%,  added 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $72.69 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Brent settled at the highest since April 2019 and scored weekly climb of 1.1%.
The IEA said that following the record decline of 8.6 mb/d in 2020, global oil demand was now forecast to rebound by 5.4 mb/d in 2021 and a further 3.1 mb/d in 2022. “The recovery will be uneven not only among regions but across sectors and products. While the end of the pandemic is in sight in advanced economies, slow vaccine distribution could still jeopardize the recovery in non-OECD countries,” it said.
The IEA also said there was scope for OPEC+ to boost production by 1.4 mb/d above its July 2021 to March 2022 target. “Our first detailed look at 2022 balances confirms earlier expectations that OPEC+ needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied.”

Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to keep its current plan to gradually increase oil production through July in place, sending crude oil futures to their highest settlements in more than two years. It’s next meeting will be held July 1.
There were still a number of factors that could affect the speed at which OPEC+ can reverse its pandemic-induced production cuts, the IEA said. “The pace at which the OPEC+ cuts can be unwound will depend not only on the success in containing the spread of the virus and demand growth but also the timing of the eventual return of Iranian barrels to the market.”
The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a weekly jump in U.S. gasoline inventories and a fall in implied demand for the fuel.
“The recent decline in demand could revert higher as the summer driving season progresses and as rising economic activity supports distillate demand,” Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit, told MarketWatch. “The recovery in the U.S. economy is still expected to drive global growth overall.”
“U.S. crude stocks are below normal at a four-month low, and could tighten further as demand is expected to increase through the summer,” he said.
Data from Baker Hughes BKR, +1.57% on Friday suggested that U.S. production may soon rise, as the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil was up by six at 365 this week.
Meanwhile, “Iran is a wildcard, depending on the outcome of nuclear talks,” said Steeves. “If successful, another one million bpd in exports could result, and OPEC would need to respond to that.”
Among the petroleum products traded on Nymex Friday, July gasoline RBN21, -1.32% fell 1.2% to nearly $2.19 a gallon, for a weekly decline of almost 1.2%, while July heating oil HON21, -1.24% lost 1.1% to $2.12 a gallon, ending just 0.04% higher than the week-ago finish.
July natural gas NGN21, 4.35%, however, rose 4.7%, to settle at nearly $3.30 per million British thermal units, with prices up 6.4% for the week. That was the highest finish since Oct. 30 of last year.
The EIA on Thursday reported an increase of 98 billion cubic feet in last week’s U.S. supplies of the fuel, which came in above the first-year average for the period, said Christin Redmond, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.
But “with record high temperatures expected for some parts of the Western U.S. over the next couple of weeks, that trend may reverse, as higher cooling demand drives higher demand for gas from power generators,” she said in a market update.

Economic Rebound vs. Inflation Risks
3EDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT JUNE 11, 2021
Play Video
By DeFred Folts III, Managing Partner, Chief Investment Strategist, and Eric Biegeleisen, CFA, Managing Director, Research Portfolio Manager
Equities:
▶ U.S. Equities: The U.S. equity market outlook is a bit more neutral currently given the tug of war between the positive impact of the global economic rebound and concerns about whether robust economic growth will prove to be inflationary, thereby prompting the Federal Reserve to withdraw its extraordinary monetary policy support sooner than anticipated. At the same time, equity markets in general, including the U.S., are continuing to benefit from accommodative central bank policies, narrowing credit spreads, and steepening yield curves.
▶ India Equities: Our model research currently finds the India equity market to be attractive. Current struggles with the pandemic and the upcoming elections should encourage highly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies for an extended period and leave room for economic improvement once vaccinations ramp up. Additional factors that enhance the prospects for the Indian equity market include the potential for future economic growth as indicated by a steepening yield curve measure, a benign interest rate environment, and favorable long-term
demographic trends.
▶ Japanese equities remain attractive and should continue to benefit from narrowing high yield spreads, steepening yield curve measures, and positive investor psychology. In addition, the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic should benefit many of Japan’s largest corporations since they tend to export their products all over the world, including into the U.S.
▶ European Equities: European companies should also continue to benefit from the sustained and extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus required to support the region because of a slower recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and inconsistent progress on vaccinations. In addition, a continued rotation from growth equities to the stocks of more cyclical companies that benefit more from the ongoing global economic recovery should continue to be positive for Europe. Early signs of increasing inflation in the Eurozone will need to be monitored.
▶ China Equities: The model outlook for Chinese equities is currently neutral. While Chinese companies benefit from accommodative monetary policies as reflected in the favorable price momentum we’ve witnessed recently, the recent uptick in U.S. inflation, elevated U.S. Treasury yields, and strengthening of the Chinese Yuan neutralizes the overall outlook in the short-term.
Fixed Income:
▶ The bond market has been relatively stable recently, even in the face of economic data indicating signs of inflationary pressures throughout the economy as the U.S. emerges from the pandemic. U.S. Treasuries represent an unattractive risk-return trade-off at current yields as they continue to yield less than the market’s expected inflation rate across nearly all maturities.
▶ Caused in part by investors searching for yield, expectations for economic recovery, and the Fed’s continued tacit support of the credit markets (corporate bonds), credit spreads – the difference between high-yield and investment-grade bond yields – have continued to narrow and junk bond issuance remains strong. However, with record amounts of corporate debt outstanding and with historically low yields for high-yield bonds, there is a heightened risk that any accident in the financial markets could cause credit spreads to widen abruptly.
Real Assets:
▶ Gold has now recovered most of the declines that it suffered earlier in 2021 and continues to be supported by negative real interest rates (nominal rates minus inflation expectations). Gold could also benefit from future inflation prospects, particularly if the Fed maintains its stance on inflation being transient and sticking to its stated timeline on interest rate policy and bond-buying programs.
▶ Commodities remain attractive due to the longstanding relative undervaluation of real assets and the prospect of a robust global economic recovery in the second half of 2021, as well as the prospects for a weaker U.S. dollar. Other factors positively impacting real assets include; appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, narrowing credit spreads, steepening global yield curves, and positive investor psychology.

Economic Rebound vs. Inflation Risks
3EDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT JUNE 11, 2021
Play Video
By DeFred Folts III, Managing Partner, Chief Investment Strategist, and Eric Biegeleisen, CFA, Managing Director, Research Portfolio Manager
Equities:
▶ U.S. Equities: The U.S. equity market outlook is a bit more neutral currently given the tug of war between the positive impact of the global economic rebound and concerns about whether robust economic growth will prove to be inflationary, thereby prompting the Federal Reserve to withdraw its extraordinary monetary policy support sooner than anticipated. At the same time, equity markets in general, including the U.S., are continuing to benefit from accommodative central bank policies, narrowing credit spreads, and steepening yield curves.
▶ India Equities: Our model research currently finds the India equity market to be attractive. Current struggles with the pandemic and the upcoming elections should encourage highly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies for an extended period and leave room for economic improvement once vaccinations ramp up. Additional factors that enhance the prospects for the Indian equity market include the potential for future economic growth as indicated by a steepening yield curve measure, a benign interest rate environment, and favorable long-term
demographic trends.
▶ Japanese equities remain attractive and should continue to benefit from narrowing high yield spreads, steepening yield curve measures, and positive investor psychology. In addition, the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic should benefit many of Japan’s largest corporations since they tend to export their products all over the world, including into the U.S.
▶ European Equities: European companies should also continue to benefit from the sustained and extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus required to support the region because of a slower recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and inconsistent progress on vaccinations. In addition, a continued rotation from growth equities to the stocks of more cyclical companies that benefit more from the ongoing global economic recovery should continue to be positive for Europe. Early signs of increasing inflation in the Eurozone will need to be monitored.
▶ China Equities: The model outlook for Chinese equities is currently neutral. While Chinese companies benefit from accommodative monetary policies as reflected in the favorable price momentum we’ve witnessed recently, the recent uptick in U.S. inflation, elevated U.S. Treasury yields, and strengthening of the Chinese Yuan neutralizes the overall outlook in the short-term.
Fixed Income:
▶ The bond market has been relatively stable recently, even in the face of economic data indicating signs of inflationary pressures throughout the economy as the U.S. emerges from the pandemic. U.S. Treasuries represent an unattractive risk-return trade-off at current yields as they continue to yield less than the market’s expected inflation rate across nearly all maturities.
▶ Caused in part by investors searching for yield, expectations for economic recovery, and the Fed’s continued tacit support of the credit markets (corporate bonds), credit spreads – the difference between high-yield and investment-grade bond yields – have continued to narrow and junk bond issuance remains strong. However, with record amounts of corporate debt outstanding and with historically low yields for high-yield bonds, there is a heightened risk that any accident in the financial markets could cause credit spreads to widen abruptly.
Real Assets:
▶ Gold has now recovered most of the declines that it suffered earlier in 2021 and continues to be supported by negative real interest rates (nominal rates minus inflation expectations). Gold could also benefit from future inflation prospects, particularly if the Fed maintains its stance on inflation being transient and sticking to its stated timeline on interest rate policy and bond-buying programs.
▶ Commodities remain attractive due to the longstanding relative undervaluation of real assets and the prospect of a robust global economic recovery in the second half of 2021, as well as the prospects for a weaker U.S. dollar. Other factors positively impacting real assets include; appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, narrowing credit spreads, steepening global yield curves, and positive investor psychology.

▶ U.S. Equities: The U.S. equity market outlook is a bit more neutral currently given the tug of war between the positive impact of the global economic rebound and concerns about whether robust economic growth will prove to be inflationary, thereby prompting the Federal Reserve to withdraw its extraordinary monetary policy support sooner than anticipated. At the same time, equity markets in general, including the U.S., are continuing to benefit from accommodative central bank policies, narrowing credit spreads, and steepening yield curves.
▶ India Equities: Our model research currently finds the India equity market to be attractive. Current struggles with the pandemic and the upcoming elections should encourage highly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies for an extended period and leave room for economic improvement once vaccinations ramp up. Additional factors that enhance the prospects for the Indian equity market include the potential for future economic growth as indicated by a steepening yield curve measure, a benign interest rate environment, and favorable long-term
demographic trends.
▶ Japanese equities remain attractive and should continue to benefit from narrowing high yield spreads, steepening yield curve measures, and positive investor psychology. In addition, the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic should benefit many of Japan’s largest corporations since they tend to export their products all over the world, including into the U.S.
▶ European Equities: European companies should also continue to benefit from the sustained and extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus required to support the region because of a slower recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and inconsistent progress on vaccinations. In addition, a continued rotation from growth equities to the stocks of more cyclical companies that benefit more from the ongoing global economic recovery should continue to be positive for Europe. Early signs of increasing inflation in the Eurozone will need to be monitored.
▶ China Equities: The model outlook for Chinese equities is currently neutral. While Chinese companies benefit from accommodative monetary policies as reflected in the favorable price momentum we’ve witnessed recently, the recent uptick in U.S. inflation, elevated U.S. Treasury yields, and strengthening of the Chinese Yuan neutralizes the overall outlook in the short-term.
Fixed Income:
▶ The bond market has been relatively stable recently, even in the face of economic data indicating signs of inflationary pressures throughout the economy as the U.S. emerges from the pandemic. U.S. Treasuries represent an unattractive risk-return trade-off at current yields as they continue to yield less than the market’s expected inflation rate across nearly all maturities.
▶ Caused in part by investors searching for yield, expectations for economic recovery, and the Fed’s continued tacit support of the credit markets (corporate bonds), credit spreads – the difference between high-yield and investment-grade bond yields – have continued to narrow and junk bond issuance remains strong. However, with record amounts of corporate debt outstanding and with historically low yields for high-yield bonds, there is a heightened risk that any accident in the financial markets could cause credit spreads to widen abruptly.
Real Assets:
▶ Gold has now recovered most of the declines that it suffered earlier in 2021 and continues to be supported by negative real interest rates (nominal rates minus inflation expectations). Gold could also benefit from future inflation prospects, particularly if the Fed maintains its stance on inflation being transient and sticking to its stated timeline on interest rate policy and bond-buying programs.
▶ Commodities remain attractive due to the longstanding relative undervaluation of real assets and the prospect of a robust global economic recovery in the second half of 2021, as well as the prospects for a weaker U.S. dollar. Other factors positively impacting real assets include; appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, narrowing credit spreads, steepening global yield curves, and positive investor psychology.

NGN21
4.35%
CLN21
0.80%
Natural-gas futures rallied on Friday, buoyed by warmer weather forecasts that are likely to boost demand for the commodity from power generators. "Demand is variable, with low load demand expected to persist through the weekend amid milder conditions, but then reverse higher next week with the return of hotter conditions," said Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit. July natural gas NGN21, 4.35% rose 15 cents, or 4.7%, to settle at nearly $3.30 per million British thermal units. That was the highest front-month contract settlement since Oct. 30 of last year. Prices rose about 6.4% for the week, FactSet data show. U.S. oil futures, meanwhile, posted gains for the session, ending the week roughly 7% higher after the IEA forecast a return to pre-COVID global oil demand levels by the end of next year. July West Texas Intermediate crude CLN21, 0.80% rose 62 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $70.91 a barrel, the highest finish since October 2018. For the week, prices gained nearly 1.9%.

AMC stock bounces, in wake of credit upgrade; GameStop stock also rises
Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. undefined bounced 3.9% in premarket trading Friday, after falling 22.2% over the past two sessions. The stock, along with some other meme stocks, took a hit Thursday after GameStop Corp. undefined disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the "trading activity" in its stock and those of other companies. GameStop's stock rallied 6.1% ahead of Friday's open, after tumbling 27.2% on Thursday. Late in Thursday's session, AMC's credit rating was upgraded by two notches, to CCC+ from CCC-, by S&P Global Ratings, which said the movie theater operator's recent equity capital raises "makes it less likely that AMC will pursue a subpar debt exchange or other forms of debt restructuring in the near future." AMC said it raised $1.25 billion from equity in the second quarter, and S&P Global pegged the capital raises at roughly $1.8 billion this year. The credit rating agency said AMC's credit outlook is positive, which suggests potential for another upgrade. The CCC+ rating, which still suggests AMC's debt is "vulnerable for nonpayment," is still seven notches deep into speculative grade, or "junk" territory. The bounce in AMC's stock, and GameStop's, comes as futures undefined for the S&P 500 undefined edged up 0.1%.

Iran Nuclear Talks Head For Crucial Weekend Discussions

The talks about bringing Iran and the United States back to the so-called Iranian nuclear deal will resume on Saturday with divergences remaining, in what would be the last attempt of the world powers to revive the agreement before the presidential election in Iran on June 18.
The oil market is watching carefully the talks in Vienna for any sign of progress or setback as a possible indication of a timeline of when Iranian oil could legitimately return to customers. The U.S. is expected to lift the sanctions on Iranian oil exports if an agreement is reached.  
“The next meeting of the Joint Commission of #JCPOA will be held this weekend. It will mark the beginning of the sixth round of the #ViennaTalks on restoration of the nuclear deal. Will it be the final round? Nobody knows but all negotiators hope so,” Mikhail Ulyanov, who leads the Russian delegation at the talks, tweeted on Friday.
In recent weeks, reports have had it that the parties preferred to nail a deal ahead of the June 18 presidential election in Iran. Although progress on some issues has been made, positions remain distant on others.
On Tuesday, comments from Iran signaled that a deal may not be announced before the presidential vote. The course Iran is taking in the talks will not change after the presidential vote because the policy is set by Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, government spokesman Ali Rabiei said, as carried by Reuters.
On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said that there were still “big issues” to be resolved in the talks, as carried by Bloomberg.
Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who under President Obama led the U.S. negotiating team that reached the original deal in 2015, said on Wednesday that “I think there’s been a lot of progress made, but, out of my own experience, until the last detail is nailed down, and I mean nailed down, we will not know if we have an agreement.”

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who under President Obama led the U.S. negotiating team that reached the original deal in 2015, said on Wednesday that “I think there’s been a lot of progress made, but, out of my own experience, until the last detail is nailed down, and I mean nailed down, we will not know if we have an agreement.”

The talks about bringing Iran and the United States back to the so-called Iranian nuclear deal will resume on Saturday with divergences remaining, in what would be the last attempt of the world powers to revive the agreement before the presidential election in Iran on June 18.
The oil market is watching carefully the talks in Vienna for any sign of progress or setback as a possible indication of a timeline of when Iranian oil could legitimately return to customers. The U.S. is expected to lift the sanctions on Iranian oil exports if an agreement is reached.  
“The next meeting of the Joint Commission of #JCPOA will be held this weekend. It will mark the beginning of the sixth round of the #ViennaTalks on restoration of the nuclear deal. Will it be the final round? Nobody knows but all negotiators hope so,” Mikhail Ulyanov, who leads the Russian delegation at the talks, tweeted on Friday.
In recent weeks, reports have had it that the parties preferred to nail a deal ahead of the June 18 presidential election in Iran. Although progress on some issues has been made, positions remain distant on others.
On Tuesday, comments from Iran signaled that a deal may not be announced before the presidential vote. The course Iran is taking in the talks will not change after the presidential vote because the policy is set by Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, government spokesman Ali Rabiei said, as carried by Reuters.
On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said that there were still “big issues” to be resolved in the talks, as carried by Bloomberg.

-0.95%
Gold futures posted losses for the session, as well as the week, on Friday, marking their lowest settlement in more than a week as strength in the U.S. dollar dulled investment demand for the precious metal. "Gold still has a lot going for it, but trade leading up to the FOMC decision [on Wednesday] could see prices settle between the $1,870 to $1,900 trading range," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. August gold GCQ21, -0.95% fell $16.80, or 0.9%, to settle at $1,879.60 an ounce, the lowest most-active contract finish since June 3, FactSet data show. For the week, prices lost about 0.7%.

AMC stock bounces, in wake of credit upgrade; GameStop stock also rises
Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. undefined bounced 3.9% in premarket trading Friday, after falling 22.2% over the past two sessions. The stock, along with some other meme stocks, took a hit Thursday after GameStop Corp. undefined disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the "trading activity" in its stock and those of other companies. GameStop's stock rallied 6.1% ahead of Friday's open, after tumbling 27.2% on Thursday. Late in Thursday's session, AMC's credit rating was upgraded by two notches, to CCC+ from CCC-, by S&P Global Ratings, which said the movie theater operator's recent equity capital raises "makes it less likely that AMC will pursue a subpar debt exchange or other forms of debt restructuring in the near future." AMC said it raised $1.25 billion from equity in the second quarter, and S&P Global pegged the capital raises at roughly $1.8 billion this year. The credit rating agency said AMC's credit outlook is positive, which suggests potential for another upgrade. The CCC+ rating, which still suggests AMC's debt is "vulnerable for nonpayment," is still seven notches deep into speculative grade, or "junk" territory. The bounce in AMC's stock, and GameStop's, comes as futures undefined for the S&P 500 undefined edged up 0.1%.

World’s Top Oil Firms Boosted Q1 Combined Profits To $46 Billion
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 11, 2021, 12:30 PM CDT
The ten largest public oil firms in the world reported combined profits of $46 billion for the first quarter of 2021, thanks to higher oil prices this year, data compiled by Anadolu Agency from financial statements showed this week.
The top ten firms that the agency analyzed—ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, Shell, BP, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco—saw their combined profits rise by $8.5 billion due to the more favorable commodity price environment and signs of recovering demand.  
To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

The top ten firms that the agency analyzed—ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, Shell, BP, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco—saw their combined profits rise by $8.5 billion due to the more favorable commodity price environment and signs of recovering demand.  
To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

World’s Top Oil Firms Boosted Q1 Combined Profits To $46 Billion
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 11, 2021, 12:30 PM CDT
The ten largest public oil firms in the world reported combined profits of $46 billion for the first quarter of 2021, thanks to higher oil prices this year, data compiled by Anadolu Agency from financial statements showed this week.
The top ten firms that the agency analyzed—ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, Shell, BP, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco—saw their combined profits rise by $8.5 billion due to the more favorable commodity price environment and signs of recovering demand.  
To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

World’s Top Oil Firms Boosted Q1 Combined Profits To $46 Billion
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 11, 2021, 12:30 PM CDT
The ten largest public oil firms in the world reported combined profits of $46 billion for the first quarter of 2021, thanks to higher oil prices this year, data compiled by Anadolu Agency from financial statements showed this week.
The top ten firms that the agency analyzed—ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, Shell, BP, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco—saw their combined profits rise by $8.5 billion due to the more favorable commodity price environment and signs of recovering demand.  
To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

Iran Says It's Ready For Speedy Oil Output Hike
World’s Top Oil Firms Boosted Q1 Combined Profits To $46 Billion
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 11, 2021, 12:30 PM CDT
The ten largest public oil firms in the world reported combined profits of $46 billion for the first quarter of 2021, thanks to higher oil prices this year, data compiled by Anadolu Agency from financial statements showed this week.
The top ten firms that the agency analyzed—ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, Shell, BP, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco—saw their combined profits rise by $8.5 billion due to the more favorable commodity price environment and signs of recovering demand.  
To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

The top ten firms that the agency analyzed—ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, Shell, BP, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco—saw their combined profits rise by $8.5 billion due to the more favorable commodity price environment and signs of recovering demand.  
To compare, in Q1 2020, when the pandemic hit oil demand and oil prices, only U.S. firm Chevron and the Saudi giant Aramco reported profits—of a total of $20.3 billion—while the other eight international and national oil majors lost a combined $17.7 billion, according to the estimates compiled by Anadolu Agency.
BP saw the largest increase in profit in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, the agency’s calculations showed.
BP reported a profit attributable to shareholders of $4.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared to a loss of $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The supermajor resumed share buybacks this quarter after more than tripling its first-quarter earnings from a year ago on the back of rising oil prices and “exceptional gas marketing and trading performance.” BP reported underlying replacement cost profit—its proxy for net profit—of $2.63 billion, up from $791 million for the first quarter of last year and from just $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In terms of revenues, Anadolu Agency’s estimates show that combined revenues of the top ten oil firms increased by 6.6 percent annually to around $387 billion. Saudi Aramco’s revenues rose the most—by 20 percent to $80 billion.
The Saudi giant also reported a 30-percent jump in net income for the first quarter of the year to $21.7 billion.

U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises As Crude Prices Climb Higher
By Julianne Geiger - Jun 11, 2021, 12:14 PM CDT
Trade Oil Futures Now
Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the number of oil and gas rigs in the United States rose this week, bringing the total rig count to 461 as U.S. drillers boast more than 100 additional rigs this year.
In the week prior, the U.S. oil and gas rig count decreased by 1. But the trend is definitely one of gaining rigs, with 110 rigs added this year to date.
The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the U.S. is now 182 more than this time last year.
The oil rig count rose by 6 this week to 365. The number of gas rigs decreased by 1 for the third week in a row, and now sits at 96. The number of miscellaneous rigs stayed the same.
The EIA’s estimate for oil production in the United States for the week ending June 4—the last available data—returned to an average of 11.0 million barrels per day compared to the 13.1 million bpd peak production reached in February 2020, before the pandemic crushed oil demand.
Canada’s overall rig count increased this week by 16. Oil and gas rigs in Canada now sit at 93 active rigs, up 72 on the year. 
The rig count in the Permian basin increased by 4 this week. At 236 rigs, the Permian’s total rig count is now 99 rigs above what it was this time last year, but hundreds below the two years ago level.
The Frac Spread Count provided by Primary Vision shows that fracking crews decreased last week to 224.  The frac spread count estimates the number of completion crews finishing off previously drilled wells. This frac count is up by nearly 100 so far this year.
At 11:37 a.m. EDT, WTI was trading up $0.53 per barrel on the day at $70.82—up nearly $1.50 per barrel on the week.
The Brent benchmark was trading up $0.16 per barrel on the day, at $72.68 per barrel.

U.S. Natural Gas Production Poised To Soar
U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises As Crude Prices Climb Higher
By Julianne Geiger - Jun 11, 2021, 12:14 PM CDT
Trade Oil Futures Now
Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the number of oil and gas rigs in the United States rose this week, bringing the total rig count to 461 as U.S. drillers boast more than 100 additional rigs this year.
In the week prior, the U.S. oil and gas rig count decreased by 1. But the trend is definitely one of gaining rigs, with 110 rigs added this year to date.
The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the U.S. is now 182 more than this time last year.
The oil rig count rose by 6 this week to 365. The number of gas rigs decreased by 1 for the third week in a row, and now sits at 96. The number of miscellaneous rigs stayed the same.
The EIA’s estimate for oil production in the United States for the week ending June 4—the last available data—returned to an average of 11.0 million barrels per day compared to the 13.1 million bpd peak production reached in February 2020, before the pandemic crushed oil demand.
Canada’s overall rig count increased this week by 16. Oil and gas rigs in Canada now sit at 93 active rigs, up 72 on the year. 
The rig count in the Permian basin increased by 4 this week. At 236 rigs, the Permian’s total rig count is now 99 rigs above what it was this time last year, but hundreds below the two years ago level.
The Frac Spread Count provided by Primary Vision shows that fracking crews decreased last week to 224.  The frac spread count estimates the number of completion crews finishing off previously drilled wells. This frac count is up by nearly 100 so far this year.
At 11:37 a.m. EDT, WTI was trading up $0.53 per barrel on the day at $70.82—up nearly $1.50 per barrel on the week.
The Brent benchmark was trading up $0.16 per barrel on the day, at $72.68 per barrel.

Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the number of oil and gas rigs in the United States rose this week, bringing the total rig count to 461 as U.S. drillers boast more than 100 additional rigs this year.
In the week prior, the U.S. oil and gas rig count decreased by 1. But the trend is definitely one of gaining rigs, with 110 rigs added this year to date.
The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the U.S. is now 182 more than this time last year.
The oil rig count rose by 6 this week to 365. The number of gas rigs decreased by 1 for the third week in a row, and now sits at 96. The number of miscellaneous rigs stayed the same.
The EIA’s estimate for oil production in the United States for the week ending June 4—the last available data—returned to an average of 11.0 million barrels per day compared to the 13.1 million bpd peak production reached in February 2020, before the pandemic crushed oil demand.
Canada’s overall rig count increased this week by 16. Oil and gas rigs in Canada now sit at 93 active rigs, up 72 on the year. 
The rig count in the Permian basin increased by 4 this week. At 236 rigs, the Permian’s total rig count is now 99 rigs above what it was this time last year, but hundreds below the two years ago level.
The Frac Spread Count provided by Primary Vision shows that fracking crews decreased last week to 224.  The frac spread count estimates the number of completion crews finishing off previously drilled wells. This frac count is up by nearly 100 so far this year.
At 11:37 a.m. EDT, WTI was trading up $0.53 per barrel on the day at $70.82—up nearly $1.50 per barrel on the week.
The Brent benchmark was trading up $0.16 per barrel on the day, at $72.68 per barrel.

California Wildfires Could Spark Fresh Wave Of Blackouts
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 11, 2021, 10:30 AM CDT
California utility PG&E Corp may have to shut down the power supply to customers more frequently during the wildfire season in the summer and the fall this year, due to exceptional drought conditions, the company’s chief risk officer Sumeet Singh told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday.
The power outages could be more frequent, but they will likely be smaller, Singh said. 
The company urged customers on Thursday to take precautions to reduce wildfire risk: 
“As California heads into wildfire season and with 77% of the state facing extreme or exceptional drought conditions, PG&E urges customers and the communities it serves to prepare now and take safety precautions to reduce wildfire risk”. 
If winds are strong, the risk of wildfires grows and could result in more power outages, the company notes. 
“The big, big variable that’s unpredictable here is the wind,” Singh told the Journal. “But in all the forecasts that we’ve done, we do not see ourselves getting back to the same kind of [power shut-off] events like we saw in 2019.” 
Back then, PG&E proactively shut off electricity supply to more than a million customers to prevent wildfires during windstorms. 
This year’s blackouts may not be as bad as in 2019, but California’s electricity grid will be more severely strained due to the drought. 
A more severe than usual drought in California has depleted reservoirs and lakes, including the ones feeding some of the largest hydropower facilities, putting the state again at risk of power outages during heat waves this summer. This year, the drought in California has reduced the output of hydropower stations and could force the state with ambitious emission-reduction targets to rely more on its remaining natural gas-powered plants for baseload electricity supply.  
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned last month in its 2021 Summer Reliability Assessment that parts of North America are at elevated or high risk of energy shortfalls this summer during above-normal peak temperatures. California falls in the “high risk” category, as it relies on large energy imports during peak demand and when solar resource output retreats in the evening hours, according to NERC.

Iran Says It's Ready For Speedy Oil Output Hike
California Wildfires Could Spark Fresh Wave Of Blackouts

California utility PG&E Corp may have to shut down the power supply to customers more frequently during the wildfire season in the summer and the fall this year, due to exceptional drought conditions, the company’s chief risk officer Sumeet Singh told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday.
The power outages could be more frequent, but they will likely be smaller, Singh said. 
The company urged customers on Thursday to take precautions to reduce wildfire risk: 
“As California heads into wildfire season and with 77% of the state facing extreme or exceptional drought conditions, PG&E urges customers and the communities it serves to prepare now and take safety precautions to reduce wildfire risk”. 
If winds are strong, the risk of wildfires grows and could result in more power outages, the company notes. 
“The big, big variable that’s unpredictable here is the wind,” Singh told the Journal. “But in all the forecasts that we’ve done, we do not see ourselves getting back to the same kind of [power shut-off] events like we saw in 2019.” 
Back then, PG&E proactively shut off electricity supply to more than a million customers to prevent wildfires during windstorms. 
This year’s blackouts may not be as bad as in 2019, but California’s electricity grid will be more severely strained due to the drought. 
A more severe than usual drought in California has depleted reservoirs and lakes, including the ones feeding some of the largest hydropower facilities, putting the state again at risk of power outages during heat waves this summer. This year, the drought in California has reduced the output of hydropower stations and could force the state with ambitious emission-reduction targets to rely more on its remaining natural gas-powered plants for baseload electricity supply.  
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned last month in its 2021 Summer Reliability Assessment that parts of North America are at elevated or high risk of energy shortfalls this summer during above-normal peak temperatures. California falls in the “high risk” category, as it relies on large energy imports during peak demand and when solar resource output retreats in the evening hours, according to NERC.

California Wildfires Could Spark Fresh Wave Of Blackouts
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 11, 2021, 10:30 AM CDT
California utility PG&E Corp may have to shut down the power supply to customers more frequently during the wildfire season in the summer and the fall this year, due to exceptional drought conditions, the company’s chief risk officer Sumeet Singh told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday.
The power outages could be more frequent, but they will likely be smaller, Singh said. 
The company urged customers on Thursday to take precautions to reduce wildfire risk: 
“As California heads into wildfire season and with 77% of the state facing extreme or exceptional drought conditions, PG&E urges customers and the communities it serves to prepare now and take safety precautions to reduce wildfire risk”. 
If winds are strong, the risk of wildfires grows and could result in more power outages, the company notes. 
“The big, big variable that’s unpredictable here is the wind,” Singh told the Journal. “But in all the forecasts that we’ve done, we do not see ourselves getting back to the same kind of [power shut-off] events like we saw in 2019.” 
Back then, PG&E proactively shut off electricity supply to more than a million customers to prevent wildfires during windstorms. 
This year’s blackouts may not be as bad as in 2019, but California’s electricity grid will be more severely strained due to the drought. 
A more severe than usual drought in California has depleted reservoirs and lakes, including the ones feeding some of the largest hydropower facilities, putting the state again at risk of power outages during heat waves this summer. This year, the drought in California has reduced the output of hydropower stations and could force the state with ambitious emission-reduction targets to rely more on its remaining natural gas-powered plants for baseload electricity supply.  
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned last month in its 2021 Summer Reliability Assessment that parts of North America are at elevated or high risk of energy shortfalls this summer during above-normal peak temperatures. California falls in the “high risk” category, as it relies on large energy imports during peak demand and when solar resource output retreats in the evening hours, according to NERC.

Goldman Sachs Doubles Down On $80 Oil Prediction
By Charles Kennedy - Jun 11, 2021, 9:00 AM CDT
Trade Oil Futures And Energy Stocks
Goldman Sachs has reiterated its forecast that Brent crude will hit $80 per barrel this summer as demand quickly recovers.
"Rising vaccination rates are leading to higher mobility in the U.S. and Europe, with global demand estimated up 1.5 mb/d (million barrels per day) in the last month to 96.5 mb/d," the investment bank said in a note as quoted by Reuters.
Goldman first said it expected Brent to hit $80 this year in March, expecting this to happen by the third quarter of this year.
Then, in April, the bank reiterated its forecast, noting, "The magnitude of the coming change in the volume of demand -- a change which supply cannot match -- must not be understated."
A month later, Goldman analysts wrote that "The case for higher oil prices therefore remains intact given the large vaccine-driven increase in demand in the face of inelastic supply," referring to the possibility that the United States and Iran will reach an agreement on the latter's nuclear program that would lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions.
The lifting of the U.S. sanctions on Iran is unanimously seen as bearish for oil prices, but observers differ in their opinion on exactly how bearish it would be. According to Goldman, the return of Iranian oil to global markets will not have a significant effect on demand dynamics and, therefore, prices.
Indeed, earlier this week, the U.S. lifted some sanctions against Tehran officials, and prices fell but not for long. At the time of writing, Brent was trading above $72 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $70.72 per barrel.
Meanwhile, OPEC has said it expected oil demand to rise by 6 million bpd this year, and the International Energy Agency forecast it would add 5.4 million bpd this year and another 3.1 million bpd next year, returning to and exceeding pre-pandemic levels to reach 100.6 million bpd by the end of 2022.

This only goes to confirm what I have been repeatedly projecting since last year that Brent crude will hit $70-$80 a barrel by the third quarter of 2021.

Moreover, the fact that global oil demand is virtually back to pre-pandemic level of 101 million barrels a day (mbd) gives more credence to an $80 oil soon.

Lifting the US sanctions on Iran is neither bearish no bullish since it isn’t going to happen even in 2023 or ever. The reason is that the positions of the United States and Iran are irreconcilable.

The lifting of sanctions on three Iranian officials is of no significance whatsoever. For Iran, only a total lifting of sanctions could entice it to have direct negotiations with the United States over the nuclear deal.

Moreover, Iran’s position could only harden towards the United States because the supporters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are headed for a landslide victory in the presidential elections on the 18th of June. They will do their very utmost to derail negotiations with the United States unless they get a deal on their own terms.

Goldman Sachs Doubles Down On $80 Oil Prediction
By Charles Kennedy - Jun 11, 2021, 9:00 AM CDT
Trade Oil Futures And Energy Stocks
Goldman Sachs has reiterated its forecast that Brent crude will hit $80 per barrel this summer as demand quickly recovers.
"Rising vaccination rates are leading to higher mobility in the U.S. and Europe, with global demand estimated up 1.5 mb/d (million barrels per day) in the last month to 96.5 mb/d," the investment bank said in a note as quoted by Reuters.
Goldman first said it expected Brent to hit $80 this year in March, expecting this to happen by the third quarter of this year.
Then, in April, the bank reiterated its forecast, noting, "The magnitude of the coming change in the volume of demand -- a change which supply cannot match -- must not be understated."
A month later, Goldman analysts wrote that "The case for higher oil prices therefore remains intact given the large vaccine-driven increase in demand in the face of inelastic supply," referring to the possibility that the United States and Iran will reach an agreement on the latter's nuclear program that would lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions.
The lifting of the U.S. sanctions on Iran is unanimously seen as bearish for oil prices, but observers differ in their opinion on exactly how bearish it would be. According to Goldman, the return of Iranian oil to global markets will not have a significant effect on demand dynamics and, therefore, prices.
Indeed, earlier this week, the U.S. lifted some sanctions against Tehran officials, and prices fell but not for long. At the time of writing, Brent was trading above $72 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $70.72 per barrel.
Meanwhile, OPEC has said it expected oil demand to rise by 6 million bpd this year, and the International Energy Agency forecast it would add 5.4 million bpd this year and another 3.1 million bpd next year, returning to and exceeding pre-pandemic levels to reach 100.6 million bpd by the end of 2022.

This only goes to confirm what I have been repeatedly projecting since last year that Brent crude will hit $70-$80 a barrel by the third quarter of 2021.

Moreover, the fact that global oil demand is virtually back to pre-pandemic level of 101 million barrels a day (mbd) gives more credence to an $80 oil soon.

Lifting the US sanctions on Iran is neither bearish no bullish since it isn’t going to happen even in 2023 or ever. The reason is that the positions of the United States and Iran are irreconcilable.

The lifting of sanctions on three Iranian officials is of no significance whatsoever. For Iran, only a total lifting of sanctions could entice it to have direct negotiations with the United States over the nuclear deal.

Moreover, Iran’s position could only harden towards the United States because the supporters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are headed for a landslide victory in the presidential elections on the 18th of June. They will do their very utmost to derail negotiations with the United States unless they get a deal on their own terms.

Goldman Sachs Doubles Down On $80 Oil Prediction

Goldman Sachs has reiterated its forecast that Brent crude will hit $80 per barrel this summer as demand quickly recovers.
"Rising vaccination rates are leading to higher mobility in the U.S. and Europe, with global demand estimated up 1.5 mb/d (million barrels per day) in the last month to 96.5 mb/d," the investment bank said in a note as quoted by Reuters.
Goldman first said it expected Brent to hit $80 this year in March, expecting this to happen by the third quarter of this year.
Then, in April, the bank reiterated its forecast, noting, "The magnitude of the coming change in the volume of demand -- a change which supply cannot match -- must not be understated."
A month later, Goldman analysts wrote that "The case for higher oil prices therefore remains intact given the large vaccine-driven increase in demand in the face of inelastic supply," referring to the possibility that the United States and Iran will reach an agreement on the latter's nuclear program that would lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions.
The lifting of the U.S. sanctions on Iran is unanimously seen as bearish for oil prices, but observers differ in their opinion on exactly how bearish it would be. According to Goldman, the return of Iranian oil to global markets will not have a significant effect on demand dynamics and, therefore, prices.
Indeed, earlier this week, the U.S. lifted some sanctions against Tehran officials, and prices fell but not for long. At the time of writing, Brent was trading above $72 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $70.72 per barrel.
Meanwhile, OPEC has said it expected oil demand to rise by 6 million bpd this year, and the International Energy Agency forecast it would add 5.4 million bpd this year and another 3.1 million bpd next year, returning to and exceeding pre-pandemic levels to reach 100.6 million bpd by the end of 2022.

This only goes to confirm what I have been repeatedly projecting since last year that Brent crude will hit $70-$80 a barrel by the third quarter of 2021.

Moreover, the fact that global oil demand is virtually back to pre-pandemic level of 101 million barrels a day (mbd) gives more credence to an $80 oil soon.

Lifting the US sanctions on Iran is neither bearish no bullish since it isn’t going to happen even in 2023 or ever. The reason is that the positions of the United States and Iran are irreconcilable.

The lifting of sanctions on three Iranian officials is of no significance whatsoever. For Iran, only a total lifting of sanctions could entice it to have direct negotiations with the United States over the nuclear deal.

Moreover, Iran’s position could only harden towards the United States because the supporters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are headed for a landslide victory in the presidential elections on the 18th of June. They will do their very utmost to derail negotiations with the United States unless they get a deal on their own terms.

Natural gas in transition: US LNG developers face shifting tide in global markets
in Oil & Companies News 11/06/2021
The efforts of Asian and European countries to address climate change and transition their economies toward cleaner energy sources will reshape two key demand centers for US LNG exports.
Asia provides US LNG with plenty of room to grow market share, but the opportunities hinge on the US remaining a low-cost supplier. In Europe, US gas will continue to play a supply balancing role for now, but the EU’s focus on carbon intensity could pose a challenge to US imports over the longer term.
Energy transition in Asia
In Asia, net-zero carbon ambitions will likely require US LNG to arrive in the form of certified low- or carbon-neutral cargoes, according to Jeff Moore, S&P Global Platts Analytics manager for Asian LNG.
Developed economies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan could take the lead in aggressively pursuing long-term emissions targets for 2050, said Moore. Importers in those countries have already begun planning on a framework for long-term carbon-neutral LNG contracts. For US producers, the new trade terms could require export cargoes delivered to Asia to meet stringent new quality standards while remaining competitively priced.
Historically, key selling points of US LNG have been price-diversification and flexibility, Moore said. Those factors could continue to give US LNG a competitive edge. In Japan, recent events have served to highlight the value of US LNG to the country’s power mix for those very reasons.
Over the past decade, Japan has become increasingly vulnerable to price fluctuations in the Northeast Asian LNG import market as the role of gas for power generation has expanded following the nuclear accident at Fukushima. In that context, the US LNG linkage to Henry Hub has been critical for price diversification. During the recent North Asian winter crisis of 2020-21, the Platts JKM — the benchmark price for spot physical cargoes delivered ex-ship into Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan — spiked to a record high $32/MMBtu, highlighting the value of a long-term contract linkage to US LNG supply.
In other Asian countries, where natural gas is helping to eliminate coal and back up renewables, it will be difficult to discount the role of US LNG as well. Existing gas infrastructure in Asia and declining indigenous supply will make US gas fundamental to the region’s market in the years ahead, Moore said.
Over the next decade, gas production from nations in South and Southeast Asia is forecast to decline by nearly 20 Bcm/year, according to Platts Analytics -– making the scope for LNG demand growth in Asia immense. The electrification of transport is only starting, and coal-backed financing is on the decline. In Japan, power and heat generation account for 68.9% of LNG demand, while in South Korea it is 53.5%. In Singapore, more importers say they are preparing to expand LNG bunkering operations.
In emerging economies such as China and India, much of the new growth is expected to come from industrial demand, fertilizers, petrochemicals and city gas. In fast-growing sectors such as local gas distribution, imported LNG is expected to help displace dirtier fuels such as biomass.
A foothold in Europe
In Europe, US LNG provided a valuable alternative to traditional pipeline supply from Russia and Norway, playing an expanding role in the market since the first cargoes were delivered in 2016.
The comparatively short shipping distance from the US to Europe, and lower delivered costs, have made US LNG a valuable supply source — particularly for nations in Western Europe. Since 2016, more than 66 Bcm of US LNG, or an average of around 13 Bcm/year, has arrived on the continent’s shores.
Last year, US LNG comprised 4.8% of the European gas market, up from 0.1% in 2016 — surpassing supply from the Netherlands at 4.1% and trailing Qatar only slightly at 5.7%, Gazprom data shows.
LNG will be important as Europe shifts from coal and nuclear power and as gas production in Europe declines, according to Platts Analytics LNG analyst Samer Mosis. That dynamic is under pressure, though, he added.
“A reality wherein the carbon-intensity of energy imports becomes a primary factor is becoming increasingly likely, and in this reality, the connection with the US could see a marked shift,” Mosis said.
LNG output from Qatar, which has been expanding production as well as tending to its emissions profile, is another obstacle to US LNG taking a firmer hold in Europe.
The country is set to boost its LNG production capacity to 126 million mt/year before the end of the decade. It has been busy sealing deals in Europe, adding around 10 million mt/year worth of long-term contracts in 2020 alone. Qatar has also pledged to capture and store more than 7 million mt/year of CO2 by 2027 and offer CO2 offsets in its term contracts with buyers.
“US suppliers looking to ensure they maintain a European option for their exports in the long term will need to take the necessary steps to begin comprehensively and verifiably measuring and mitigating emissions across their value chains,” Mosis said.
The European Commission plans to introduce legislation designed to reduce emissions, including a carbon-border adjustment mechanism and a tool to potentially penalize significant methane emitters.
Amid growing wariness in Europe over the carbon-intensity of US gas, France’s Engie in November 2020 pulled out of talks for a long-term supply deal with US LNG company NextDecade. The French government and environmentalists had reportedly urged Engie to reject the deal because of the environmental impact of LNG sourced from gas produced using hydraulic fracturing.
The same concern prompted the Irish government to impose a moratorium on the development of LNG import infrastructure and to specifically rule out imports of LNG produced from shale gas. Ireland has no LNG import infrastructure at present, but two projects are still under development: US company New Fortress Energy’s Shannon LNG terminal, and a floating import terminal project being developed by UK-listed Predator Oil and Gas.
The EU, however, doesn’t see its policy goals necessarily becoming an impediment to importing US LNG in the coming years. Anne-Charlotte Bournoville, head of international relations and enlargement at the EC’s energy directorate, said the EU and US were “not going in different directions.”
“We both agree that we have to step up measurement, reporting and verification as a necessary condition to the reduction of methane emissions,” Bournoville said in November 2020.
However, European purchasers could show a preference for “best in class” suppliers, she said.
Shell’s head of integrated gas, Maarten Wetselaar, in February called on the EU and US to cooperate on emissions regulations.
“If we can get EU legislation and EU performance standards [and] a similar system in the US so we can declare equivalence between the two, [that] would really help the trade between the two in terms of LNG and would set an example for the world to follow,” he said.
US trade group LNG Allies’ President Fred Hutchison said the turnaround in policy direction under the Biden administration is already easing some of the pressure between Europe and the US.

The European Commission plans to introduce legislation designed to reduce emissions, including a carbon-border adjustment mechanism and a tool to potentially penalize significant methane emitters.
Amid growing wariness in Europe over the carbon-intensity of US gas, France’s Engie in November 2020 pulled out of talks for a long-term supply deal with US LNG company NextDecade. The French government and environmentalists had reportedly urged Engie to reject the deal because of the environmental impact of LNG sourced from gas produced using hydraulic fracturing.
The same concern prompted the Irish government to impose a moratorium on the development of LNG import infrastructure and to specifically rule out imports of LNG produced from shale gas. Ireland has no LNG import infrastructure at present, but two projects are still under development: US company New Fortress Energy’s Shannon LNG terminal, and a floating import terminal project being developed by UK-listed Predator Oil and Gas.
The EU, however, doesn’t see its policy goals necessarily becoming an impediment to importing US LNG in the coming years. Anne-Charlotte Bournoville, head of international relations and enlargement at the EC’s energy directorate, said the EU and US were “not going in different directions.”
“We both agree that we have to step up measurement, reporting and verification as a necessary condition to the reduction of methane emissions,” Bournoville said in November 2020.
However, European purchasers could show a preference for “best in class” suppliers, she said.
Shell’s head of integrated gas, Maarten Wetselaar, in February called on the EU and US to cooperate on emissions regulations.
“If we can get EU legislation and EU performance standards [and] a similar system in the US so we can declare equivalence between the two, [that] would really help the trade between the two in terms of LNG and would set an example for the world to follow,” he said.
US trade group LNG Allies’ President Fred Hutchison said the turnaround in policy direction under the Biden administration is already easing some of the pressure between Europe and the US.

Natural gas in transition: US LNG developers face shifting tide in global markets
in Oil & Companies News 11/06/2021
The efforts of Asian and European countries to address climate change and transition their economies toward cleaner energy sources will reshape two key demand centers for US LNG exports.
Asia provides US LNG with plenty of room to grow market share, but the opportunities hinge on the US remaining a low-cost supplier. In Europe, US gas will continue to play a supply balancing role for now, but the EU’s focus on carbon intensity could pose a challenge to US imports over the longer term.
Energy transition in Asia
In Asia, net-zero carbon ambitions will likely require US LNG to arrive in the form of certified low- or carbon-neutral cargoes, according to Jeff Moore, S&P Global Platts Analytics manager for Asian LNG.
Developed economies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan could take the lead in aggressively pursuing long-term emissions targets for 2050, said Moore. Importers in those countries have already begun planning on a framework for long-term carbon-neutral LNG contracts. For US producers, the new trade terms could require export cargoes delivered to Asia to meet stringent new quality standards while remaining competitively priced.
Historically, key selling points of US LNG have been price-diversification and flexibility, Moore said. Those factors could continue to give US LNG a competitive edge. In Japan, recent events have served to highlight the value of US LNG to the country’s power mix for those very reasons.
Over the past decade, Japan has become increasingly vulnerable to price fluctuations in the Northeast Asian LNG import market as the role of gas for power generation has expanded following the nuclear accident at Fukushima. In that context, the US LNG linkage to Henry Hub has been critical for price diversification. During the recent North Asian winter crisis of 2020-21, the Platts JKM — the benchmark price for spot physical cargoes delivered ex-ship into Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan — spiked to a record high $32/MMBtu, highlighting the value of a long-term contract linkage to US LNG supply.
In other Asian countries, where natural gas is helping to eliminate coal and back up renewables, it will be difficult to discount the role of US LNG as well. Existing gas infrastructure in Asia and declining indigenous supply will make US gas fundamental to the region’s market in the years ahead, Moore said.
Over the next decade, gas production from nations in South and Southeast Asia is forecast to decline by nearly 20 Bcm/year, according to Platts Analytics -– making the scope for LNG demand growth in Asia immense. The electrification of transport is only starting, and coal-backed financing is on the decline. In Japan, power and heat generation account for 68.9% of LNG demand, while in South Korea it is 53.5%. In Singapore, more importers say they are preparing to expand LNG bunkering operations.
In emerging economies such as China and India, much of the new growth is expected to come from industrial demand, fertilizers, petrochemicals and city gas. In fast-growing sectors such as local gas distribution, imported LNG is expected to help displace dirtier fuels such as biomass.
A foothold in Europe
In Europe, US LNG provided a valuable alternative to traditional pipeline supply from Russia and Norway, playing an expanding role in the market since the first cargoes were delivered in 2016.
The comparatively short shipping distance from the US to Europe, and lower delivered costs, have made US LNG a valuable supply source — particularly for nations in Western Europe. Since 2016, more than 66 Bcm of US LNG, or an average of around 13 Bcm/year, has arrived on the continent’s shores.
Last year, US LNG comprised 4.8% of the European gas market, up from 0.1% in 2016 — surpassing supply from the Netherlands at 4.1% and trailing Qatar only slightly at 5.7%, Gazprom data shows.
LNG will be important as Europe shifts from coal and nuclear power and as gas production in Europe declines, according to Platts Analytics LNG analyst Samer Mosis. That dynamic is under pressure, though, he added.
“A reality wherein the carbon-intensity of energy imports becomes a primary factor is becoming increasingly likely, and in this reality, the connection with the US could see a marked shift,” Mosis said.
LNG output from Qatar, which has been expanding production as well as tending to its emissions profile, is another obstacle to US LNG taking a firmer hold in Europe.
The country is set to boost its LNG production capacity to 126 million mt/year before the end of the decade. It has been busy sealing deals in Europe, adding around 10 million mt/year worth of long-term contracts in 2020 alone. Qatar has also pledged to capture and store more than 7 million mt/year of CO2 by 2027 and offer CO2 offsets in its term contracts with buyers.
“US suppliers looking to ensure they maintain a European option for their exports in the long term will need to take the necessary steps to begin comprehensively and verifiably measuring and mitigating emissions across their value chains,” Mosis said.

Norway not ready to let go of oil, gas in push for hydrogen, offshore wind
in Oil & Companies News 11/06/2021
Norway is betting on hydrogen and offshore wind for the energy transition but will also continue to extract oil and gas, the centre-right government said as it presented its long-term energy strategy on Friday.
Norway, Europe’s second largest oil and gas producer, will continue to offer regular licensing rounds, offering exploration acreage to energy firms, the government said.
“The main goal of the government’s petroleum policy – to facilitate profitable production in the oil and gas industry in a long term perspective – is firmly in place,” Minister of Petroleum and Energy Tina Bru told a news conference.
Norway will use hydroelectric power from land to cut emissions from its extensive offshore network of oil and gas platforms, but petroleum will not be the driving force of the economy that it once was, she added.
“We will facilitate a future-oriented Norwegian oil and gas industry capable of delivering production with low emissions within the framework of our climate policy,” Bru said.

Norway not ready to let go of oil, gas in push for hydrogen, offshore wind
in Oil & Companies News 11/06/2021
Norway is betting on hydrogen and offshore wind for the energy transition but will also continue to extract oil and gas, the centre-right government said as it presented its long-term energy strategy on Friday.
Norway, Europe’s second largest oil and gas producer, will continue to offer regular licensing rounds, offering exploration acreage to energy firms, the government said.
“The main goal of the government’s petroleum policy – to facilitate profitable production in the oil and gas industry in a long term perspective – is firmly in place,” Minister of Petroleum and Energy Tina Bru told a news conference.
Norway will use hydroelectric power from land to cut emissions from its extensive offshore network of oil and gas platforms, but petroleum will not be the driving force of the economy that it once was, she added.
“We will facilitate a future-oriented Norwegian oil and gas industry capable of delivering production with low emissions within the framework of our climate policy,” Bru said.

Oil prices climbed Friday, tallying a third-weekly gain to finish at a more than two-year high, as the International Energy Agency said it expects global oil demand to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by the end of next year.
Producers will need to increase output to keep up with demand recovery, the Paris-based energy agency said in its June oil market report. It forecasts demand to rise in 2021 before growing at a faster rate next year, reaching 100.6 million barrels a day (mb/d) by the end of 2022.
The market “can’t ignore the clearly bullish signal” from the IEA report, in which the IEA calls for more oil to be produced by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, “to meet the oil demand recovery of 2022,” said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.
“Supply conservatism by OPEC+ has supported oil prices since last year and is the reason prices have now reached such highs,” she said in a daily note. “There is definitely room for OPEC+ to boost output from the second part of this year and as long as this doesn’t happen, there is a definite upside for oil prices.”
On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery  CL00, 0.81% CLN21, +0.81% rose 62 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $70.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange — the highest since October 2018.
Based on the front-month contracts, WTI prices saw a weekly rise of nearly 1.9%, their third weekly climb in a row, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

August Brent crude, the global benchmark BRN00, -0.07% BRNQ21, -0.07%,  added 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $72.69 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Brent settled at the highest since April 2019 and scored weekly climb of 1.1%.
The IEA said that following the record decline of 8.6 mb/d in 2020, global oil demand was now forecast to rebound by 5.4 mb/d in 2021 and a further 3.1 mb/d in 2022. “The recovery will be uneven not only among regions but across sectors and products. While the end of the pandemic is in sight in advanced economies, slow vaccine distribution could still jeopardize the recovery in non-OECD countries,” it said.
The IEA also said there was scope for OPEC+ to boost production by 1.4 mb/d above its July 2021 to March 2022 target. “Our first detailed look at 2022 balances confirms earlier expectations that OPEC+ needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied.”

Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to keep its current plan to gradually increase oil production through July in place, sending crude oil futures to their highest settlements in more than two years. It’s next meeting will be held July 1.
There were still a number of factors that could affect the speed at which OPEC+ can reverse its pandemic-induced production cuts, the IEA said. “The pace at which the OPEC+ cuts can be unwound will depend not only on the success in containing the spread of the virus and demand growth but also the timing of the eventual return of Iranian barrels to the market.”
The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a weekly jump in U.S. gasoline inventories and a fall in implied demand for the fuel.
“The recent decline in demand could revert higher as the summer driving season progresses and as rising economic activity supports distillate demand,” Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit, told MarketWatch. “The recovery in the U.S. economy is still expected to drive global growth overall.”
“U.S. crude stocks are below normal at a four-month low, and could tighten further as demand is expected to increase through the summer,” he said.
Data from Baker Hughes BKR, +1.57% on Friday suggested that U.S. production may soon rise, as the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil was up by six at 365 this week.
Meanwhile, “Iran is a wildcard, depending on the outcome of nuclear talks,” said Steeves. “If successful, another one million bpd in exports could result, and OPEC would need to respond to that.”
Among the petroleum products traded on Nymex Friday, July gasoline RBN21, -1.27% fell 1.2% to nearly $2.19 a gallon, for a weekly decline of almost 1.2%, while July heating oil HON21, -1.16% lost 1.1% to $2.12 a gallon, ending just 0.04% higher than the week-ago finish.
July natural gas NGN21, +4.32%, however, rose 4.7%, to settle at nearly $3.30 per million British thermal units, with prices up 6.4% for the week. That was the highest finish since Oct. 30 of last year.
The EIA on Thursday reported an increase of 98 billion cubic feet in last week’s U.S. supplies of the fuel, which came in above the first-year average for the period, said Christin Redmond, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.
But “with record high temperatures expected for some parts of the Western U.S. over the next couple of weeks, that trend may reverse, as higher cooling demand drives higher demand for gas from power generators,” she said in a market update.

Oil prices climbed Friday, tallying a third-weekly gain to finish at a more than two-year high, as the International Energy Agency said it expects global oil demand to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by the end of next year.
Producers will need to increase output to keep up with demand recovery, the Paris-based energy agency said in its June oil market report. It forecasts demand to rise in 2021 before growing at a faster rate next year, reaching 100.6 million barrels a day (mb/d) by the end of 2022.
The market “can’t ignore the clearly bullish signal” from the IEA report, in which the IEA calls for more oil to be produced by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, “to meet the oil demand recovery of 2022,” said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.
“Supply conservatism by OPEC+ has supported oil prices since last year and is the reason prices have now reached such highs,” she said in a daily note. “There is definitely room for OPEC+ to boost output from the second part of this year and as long as this doesn’t happen, there is a definite upside for oil prices.”
On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery  CL00, 0.81% CLN21, +0.81% rose 62 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $70.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange — the highest since October 2018.
Based on the front-month contracts, WTI prices saw a weekly rise of nearly 1.9%, their third weekly climb in a row, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

August Brent crude, the global benchmark BRN00, -0.07% BRNQ21, -0.07%,  added 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $72.69 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Brent settled at the highest since April 2019 and scored weekly climb of 1.1%.
The IEA said that following the record decline of 8.6 mb/d in 2020, global oil demand was now forecast to rebound by 5.4 mb/d in 2021 and a further 3.1 mb/d in 2022. “The recovery will be uneven not only among regions but across sectors and products. While the end of the pandemic is in sight in advanced economies, slow vaccine distribution could still jeopardize the recovery in non-OECD countries,” it said.
The IEA also said there was scope for OPEC+ to boost production by 1.4 mb/d above its July 2021 to March 2022 target. “Our first detailed look at 2022 balances confirms earlier expectations that OPEC+ needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied.”

Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to keep its current plan to gradually increase oil production through July in place, sending crude oil futures to their highest settlements in more than two years. It’s next meeting will be held July 1.
There were still a number of factors that could affect the speed at which OPEC+ can reverse its pandemic-induced production cuts, the IEA said. “The pace at which the OPEC+ cuts can be unwound will depend not only on the success in containing the spread of the virus and demand growth but also the timing of the eventual return of Iranian barrels to the market.”
The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a weekly jump in U.S. gasoline inventories and a fall in implied demand for the fuel.
“The recent decline in demand could revert higher as the summer driving season progresses and as rising economic activity supports distillate demand,” Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit, told MarketWatch. “The recovery in the U.S. economy is still expected to drive global growth overall.”
“U.S. crude stocks are below normal at a four-month low, and could tighten further as demand is expected to increase through the summer,” he said.
Data from Baker Hughes BKR, +1.57% on Friday suggested that U.S. production may soon rise, as the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil was up by six at 365 this week.
Meanwhile, “Iran is a wildcard, depending on the outcome of nuclear talks,” said Steeves. “If successful, another one million bpd in exports could result, and OPEC would need to respond to that.”
Among the petroleum products traded on Nymex Friday, July gasoline RBN21, -1.27% fell 1.2% to nearly $2.19 a gallon, for a weekly decline of almost 1.2%, while July heating oil HON21, -1.16% lost 1.1% to $2.12 a gallon, ending just 0.04% higher than the week-ago finish.
July natural gas NGN21, 4.32%, however, rose 4.7%, to settle at nearly $3.30 per million British thermal units, with prices up 6.4% for the week. That was the highest finish since Oct. 30 of last year.
The EIA on Thursday reported an increase of 98 billion cubic feet in last week’s U.S. supplies of the fuel, which came in above the first-year average for the period, said Christin Redmond, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.
But “with record high temperatures expected for some parts of the Western U.S. over the next couple of weeks, that trend may reverse, as higher cooling demand drives higher demand for gas from power generators,” she said in a market update.

Oil up 10% in three weeks
Oil prices are edging quietly higher, extending gains from the previous session. Both benchmarks are on track to book gains of around 1.0% this week, the third straight weekly rise. The improving demand outlook, amid successful vaccine programmes, and rising consumption as economies reopen, has boosted oil prices by 10% over the past three weeks.
Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to reach USD80.00 a barrel this summer, and that is looking like a very real possibility.
News that Saudi Arabia has unwound its voluntary production cuts has been shrugged off. The oil market clearly believes that the demand side of the equation can absorb the additional supply re-entering the market.
Gasoline inventories earlier in the week were disappointing, particularly as the US summer driving season kicks off. However, road traffic data points to traffic levels in North America and most of Europe returning to pre-pandemic levels, which is helping to keep the tone bullish.
Covid-19 aside, the one real headwind comes from the potential revival of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and Iranian oil flooding back to the market. However, this risk is proving to a slow burner.
Gold eases on rebounding USD 
Gold jumped higher in the previous session, touching USD1900.00an ounce before easing a few dollars lower. Gold, which is often considered a hedge against inflation, fell initially on surging US inflation, but found support from falling US Treasury yields. Yields falling on rising inflation appears counter initiative, but as inflation is surging interest rate expectations are not, which is a sweet spot for gold.
What more could gold want? Rising inflation and a Federal Reserve willing to sit on its hands? Whilst gold is edging lower on a stronger US dollar, a move over USD1900.00 an ounce is not out of the question. That opens the door for a move towards resistance at USD1916.00. Failure to reclaim the USD1900.00 level could see the price ease back towards the USD1890.00 an ounce comfort zone.

Slow Vaccinations in Developing World Set to Drag on Oil Demand
IEA forecasts return to record demand by end of next year

TEXT
The world’s appetite for crude oil will return to its pre-pandemic highs by the end of next year but low coronavirus vaccination rates in emerging economies are pushing the pandemic’s end date further away, the International Energy Agency said Friday.
In its market report, the energy watchdog said that while it expects global oil demand in 2022’s final quarter to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019, it was also slashing its forecast for resurgent demand in the second half of this year.
The IEA said the world will want approximately 300,000 barrels a day of crude less than previously thought in this year’s final two quarters because of slow vaccination campaigns in countries such as Brazil, India and Malaysia.
“The uneven distribution of vaccines at the global level means that this situation could persist in the second half of 2021 and into 2022, unless access to vaccines improves,” the IEA said. The report comes the day after a Wall Street Journal analysis showed that more people have died from Covid-19 already this year than in all of 2020.
At the same time, the world has finally burned off the glut of oil it built up when pandemic restrictions grounded flights and shut factories and restaurants last spring. After inventories threatened to exceed storage in the first half of 2020, developed-world oil stocks fell in May to below their pre-pandemic five-year average for the first time in more than a year, hitting their lowest since February 2020, the IEA said.

Slow Vaccinations in Developing World Set to Drag on Oil Demand
IEA forecasts return to record demand by end of next year

The world’s appetite for crude oil will return to its pre-pandemic highs by the end of next year but low coronavirus vaccination rates in emerging economies are pushing the pandemic’s end date further away, the International Energy Agency said Friday.

The world’s appetite for crude oil will return to its pre-pandemic highs by the end of next year but low coronavirus vaccination rates in emerging economies are pushing the pandemic’s end date further away, the International Energy Agency said Friday.
In its market report, the energy watchdog said that while it expects global oil demand in 2022’s final quarter to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019, it was also slashing its forecast for resurgent demand in the second half of this year.
The IEA said the world will want approximately 300,000 barrels a day of crude less than previously thought in this year’s final two quarters because of slow vaccination campaigns in countries such as Brazil, India and Malaysia.
“The uneven distribution of vaccines at the global level means that this situation could persist in the second half of 2021 and into 2022, unless access to vaccines improves,” the IEA said. The report comes the day after a Wall Street Journal analysis showed that more people have died from Covid-19 already this year than in all of 2020.
At the same time, the world has finally burned off the glut of oil it built up when pandemic restrictions grounded flights and shut factories and restaurants last spring. After inventories threatened to exceed storage in the first half of 2020, developed-world oil stocks fell in May to below their pre-pandemic five-year average for the first time in more than a year, hitting their lowest since February 2020, the IEA said.

Looking to Bonds for Volatility Protection? Going Green May Be Golden
TOM LYDON JUNE 11, 2021
When things get raucous in equity markets, investors often turn to bonds and gold to take some of the edge off.
Investors looking to simply embrace one of those asset classes as a buffer against volatility may want to consider green bonds, which are accessible in exchange traded fund form via the VanEck Vectors Green Bond ETF (NYSEArca: GRNB).
Green debt is offered by both corporate and sovereign issuers and is a small but growing segment of the broader fixed income market. It’s also young relative to other bond segments, with the first green bonds issued in 2007. Youth aside, research conducted by Imran Yousaf of Pakistan’s Air University, Muhammed Tahir Suleman of the University of Otago in New Zealand, and Riza Demirer of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, indicates green bonds held up remarkably well during the coronavirus market swoon of 2020.
In fact, the bonds found in GRNB proved to be better at beating volatility than gold.
“Our findings show that green investments are not necessarily a luxury good for dedicated investors, but have now developed into a necessity with the potential to provide significant investment benefits, even during crisis periods,” according to the paper.
More Positives for ‘GRNB’
GRNB holds 270 bonds, roughly three-quarters of which carry investment-grade ratings. Of that group, about 52% carry ratings of AAA, AA, or A.
In other words, credit risk within the GRNB portfolio isn’t excessive, and with an effective duration of 5.57 years, GRNB isn’t overly vulnerable to sharp changes in long-term interest rates. GRNB has other benefits because green bonds not only act as portfolio diversifiers with commodities and equities, but have protective qualities, too.
“Portfolio analysis further shows that supplementing conventional stock portfolios with green bonds during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the highest risk-adjusted returns, compared to those supplemented with other alternative assets in the sample,” note the researchers.
GRNB can deliver on pure performance. Over the past year, the VanEck ETF is modestly higher while the widely followed Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index is down almost 2%.
Green bonds are also beating out gold. The research team said that during the coronavirus market tumble, green bonds “are the only alternative asset that plays the role of a strong safe haven against the S&P 500 during periods of heightened uncertainty associated with the pandemic.”
Moreover, when green bonds are properly weighted within a portfolio, they didn’t just beat gold during the COVID-19 volatility; the asset class actually topped other environmental, social, and governance (ESG) instruments.

In other words, credit risk within the GRNB portfolio isn’t excessive, and with an effective duration of 5.57 years, GRNB isn’t overly vulnerable to sharp changes in long-term interest rates. GRNB has other benefits because green bonds not only act as portfolio diversifiers with commodities and equities, but have protective qualities, too.
“Portfolio analysis further shows that supplementing conventional stock portfolios with green bonds during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the highest risk-adjusted returns, compared to those supplemented with other alternative assets in the sample,” note the researchers.
GRNB can deliver on pure performance. Over the past year, the VanEck ETF is modestly higher while the widely followed Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index is down almost 2%.
Green bonds are also beating out gold. The research team said that during the coronavirus market tumble, green bonds “are the only alternative asset that plays the role of a strong safe haven against the S&P 500 during periods of heightened uncertainty associated with the pandemic.”
Moreover, when green bonds are properly weighted within a portfolio, they didn’t just beat gold during the COVID-19 volatility; the asset class actually topped other environmental, social, and governance (ESG) instruments.

Oil Recedes But Still Rising For The Third Week On Demand Surge
by John Wanguba June 11, 2021 in FX Industry Reading Time: 5min read
The prices of oil dropped on June 11, 2021, but look set for a third weekly rise on the expectations for a demand recovery in China, Europe, and the United States. Rising vaccination rates are constantly leading to an easing of pandemic lockdowns and limitations.
Brent crude futures lost 16 cents (0.22%) to trade at $72.36 a barrel at 0558 GMT after oil markets closed at their highest since May 2019. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 9 cents or 0.13% to trade at $70.20 per barrel. Brent gained 0.5% on Thursday to reach its highest close since October 2018.
As it stands, Brent is set for a weekly gain of 0.7% while WTI is set to rise by 0.8%. the world’s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, will now supply full volumes of July-loading crude to its Asian clients, Reuters reported on June 11. Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA, wrote:
“News that Saudi Arabia has unwound all its voluntary production cuts are circulating in Asia today, and that appears to have temporarily pushed oil prices lower. The reaction is modest, though, and if anything, the price action is bullish. It suggests that the physical market has absorbed extra Saudi production with ease and that demand globally is robust and climbing.”
The gasoline inventories in the United States, the biggest oil consumer in the world, rose by 7 million barrels in the week to June 4. The distillate stockpiles rose by 4.4 million barrels. These increases were much more than the analysts had projected, based on data acquired from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on June 9.
That unprecedented surge spurred profit-taking activity as the prices hit a two-and-half-year high, said Margaret Yang, an oil market strategist. Moreover, data showing road traffic to the pre-COVID-19 levels in North America and most of Europe was encouraging. Analysts said in a note:
“Even the jet fuel market is showing signs of improvement, with flights in Europe rising 17% over the past two weeks, according to Eurocontrol.”
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reinforced the view of growing demand, sticking to its projection that demand in 2021 would rise by around 5.95 million barrels per day, which is 6.6% higher from a year earlier. OPEC said during its monthly report on June 10:
“Overall, the recovery in global economic growth, and hence oil demand, are expected to gain momentum in the second half.”
Brent Might Rise To $80 In Northern Summer
Analysts at Goldman Sachs remain quite constructive on the price outlook for the Brent crude oil amid the prospects of growing demand. They mentioned:
“Brent will see higher $80/bbl in Northern summer. Sees jet fuel demand accelerating. Sees continued rise in demand. Demand will hit 90m bbl/day in August. Despite excess capacity, OPEC+ will fall behind the growing demand.”
The open interest in gold futures markets surged for another session, according to preliminary data acquired from CME, this time around 5.3K contracts. Volume followed suit and surged by nearly 110.5K contracts, reversing the previous daily plunge.
This uptick in gold prices was on the back of growing open interest and volume, exposing an uptrend in the short term with the nearest target at the June peaks of about $1,915 per ounce.

As it stands, Brent is set for a weekly gain of 0.7% while WTI is set to rise by 0.8%. the world’s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, will now supply full volumes of July-loading crude to its Asian clients, Reuters reported on June 11. Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA, wrote:
“News that Saudi Arabia has unwound all its voluntary production cuts are circulating in Asia today, and that appears to have temporarily pushed oil prices lower. The reaction is modest, though, and if anything, the price action is bullish. It suggests that the physical market has absorbed extra Saudi production with ease and that demand globally is robust and climbing.”
The gasoline inventories in the United States, the biggest oil consumer in the world, rose by 7 million barrels in the week to June 4. The distillate stockpiles rose by 4.4 million barrels. These increases were much more than the analysts had projected, based on data acquired from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on June 9.
That unprecedented surge spurred profit-taking activity as the prices hit a two-and-half-year high, said Margaret Yang, an oil market strategist. Moreover, data showing road traffic to the pre-COVID-19 levels in North America and most of Europe was encouraging. Analysts said in a note:
“Even the jet fuel market is showing signs of improvement, with flights in Europe rising 17% over the past two weeks, according to Eurocontrol.”
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reinforced the view of growing demand, sticking to its projection that demand in 2021 would rise by around 5.95 million barrels per day, which is 6.6% higher from a year earlier. OPEC said during its monthly report on June 10:
“Overall, the recovery in global economic growth, and hence oil demand, are expected to gain momentum in the second half.”
Brent Might Rise To $80 In Northern Summer
Analysts at Goldman Sachs remain quite constructive on the price outlook for the Brent crude oil amid the prospects of growing demand. They mentioned:
“Brent will see higher $80/bbl in Northern summer. Sees jet fuel demand accelerating. Sees continued rise in demand. Demand will hit 90m bbl/day in August. Despite excess capacity, OPEC+ will fall behind the growing demand.”
The open interest in gold futures markets surged for another session, according to preliminary data acquired from CME, this time around 5.3K contracts. Volume followed suit and surged by nearly 110.5K contracts, reversing the previous daily plunge.
This uptick in gold prices was on the back of growing open interest and volume, exposing an uptrend in the short term with the nearest target at the June peaks of about $1,915 per ounce.

The prices of oil dropped on June 11, 2021, but look set for a third weekly rise on the expectations for a demand recovery in China, Europe, and the United States. Rising vaccination rates are constantly leading to an easing of pandemic lockdowns and limitations.
