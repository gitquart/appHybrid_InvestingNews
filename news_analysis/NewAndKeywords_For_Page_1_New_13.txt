USDR - A Stablecoin Game-Changer
  |  Published 59 minutes ago
By Crypto Daily
Precious metals like Gold have been a part of prime commodities in the trade market. Despite the volatile movements of the Gold market, the cryptocurrency trade market is now looking at gold-backed tokens with the strategy to make cryptos more stable and reliable.
The idea of a digital gold currency as an effective and alternative payment system is as old as the internet itself. There has been immense interest building up in creating a gold-backed digital currency since the early days of the industry. These gold-backed digital currencies link a token to a specific quantity of gold. 
The alternative payment in the form of a stable gold coin is innovative and will ensure augmented reachability, better accessibility, heightened efficiency, and more importantly transparency of transactions. Hence, in a nutshell, a gold-backed token is more like a derivative digital asset whose value is underwritten by the equivalent price in gold. Its equivalent should be present in the reserves and vaults as physical collateralized assets. 
In this article, we take a look at USDR, a stable coin designed to transform the way users transact in cryptocurrency. 
Understanding USDR
USD Reserve or USDR has been designed to function as a cryptographic digital payment token. The token is issued on both Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). USDR’s primary goal is to be recognizable under Swiss law as a payment token that will not only increase its global reach but also make it a must for every investor. The law will be the ultimate determinant of its usage and by who. USDR is multi-pronged in its use as wallet operators, traders, payment processors, merchants, service providers, etc can use it as a means of payment on the blockchain. 
Based on cryptographically secure open-source blockchain protocols and smart contracts, USD Reserve tokens offer security to each and every user. USDR tokens are pegged with the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio and backed by 100% reserves.
USDR is multiplatform
The best thing about USDR is that it functions equally well in multifarious networks all at once. This makes up for a sturdy stablecoin structure without any loss of convenience. The eclectic team behind USDR has also initiated innovative logic for interchanging coins between different networks. 
Exclusive Supply tracker
USDR has been reformed in a manner that ensures it is 100% transparent and open. The supply of the tokens is expanded only when processing mined Gold. This implies that every new coin so released is totally backed by gold. 
USDR’s supply control is an important solution that consists of the inter-network component. As discussed earlier, the interchangeability of the tokens is easy and will take place through USDR issuance and exchanges. If users are looking to transact through exchanges then it will be buying and selling of coins already in circulation. Every single network will consist of an address in which the inactive coins will be stored as reserves for users. It will also have something called the system address for multi-network exchange. 
USDR decentralized wallet
The USDR decentralized wallet offers users a competitive solution. to buy, store, send, and even exchange tokens in a secure manner. Ensuring user privacy and security is the priority for USDR, and is implemented with a key vault, secure login measures, and efficient management of digital assets. User control is key which is why the wallet’s simplistic interface allows users to conveniently connect to different blockchain-based applications. 
Conclusion
The biggest advantage of USDR is that they offer investors greater security with their gold reserve backing. In addition, the stablecoin can be transferred peer to peer with no third-party interaction. Other advantages include:
Transparency and Security,
Availability on several other networks apart from Ethereum and BSC. 
Interoperability between  networks
Compliance with the Swiss laws 
Blockchain-based digital assets, especially backed by gold, are attracting more and more investors due to their safe haven characteristics. USDR offers a hedge against fiat currencies or regulation-bound stablecoins.
