(Reuters) -Power and natural gas prices in Texas and California spiked this week to their highest levels in months as homes and businesses cranked up air conditioners to escape brutal heatwaves.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates most of the state's power system, urged consumers on Monday to conserve energy during peak hours through Friday. The California ISO, which operates most of that state's grid, told consumers to prepare to conserve energy if needed.
Both grids have imposed rotating outages over the last year to avoid widespread collapses of their power systems - California in August 2020 and Texas in February 2021.
Rotating outages are supposed to leave a limited number of customers without service for a short time before switching to another group of customers. In Texas, ERCOT drew criticism after millions of homes and businesses were left in the dark - many for days.
For this week, ERCOT forecast power demand would peak at 70,816 megawatts (MW) on Tuesday, up from 69,943 MW on Monday, which was a record high for June. The grid's all-time high was 74,820 MW in August 2019. One MW typically powers about 200 homes on a hot summer day.
To meet that peak and have enough reserves in case something goes wrong, ERCOT has said it expects to have about 86,862 MW of supply available this summer. On Monday, however, the grid said an unusually large 11,000 MW of generation was out of service.
About 1,200 MW of power was regained overnight as some repairs were completed, it said on Tuesday.
In California, the ISO forecast power demand would reach 39,856 MW on Tuesday and 41,219 MW on Wednesday. That compares with the grid's all-time peak of 50,270 MW in July 2006.
To meet that peak and have enough reserves, the California ISO said it expects to have about 50,734 MW of supply available this summer.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices rose nearly 2% to their highest in more than two years on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations demand will recover rapidly in the second half of 2021.
Brent crude
U.S. oil rose $1.24, or 1.8%, to settle at $72.12 a barrel. It hit a session high of $72.19 a barrel, its highest since October 2018.
Boosting prices, the world's biggest oil traders said on Tuesday they see oil prices staying above $70 a barrel with demand expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2022.
Vitol Chief Executive Russell Hardy sees oil moving between $70 and $80 a barrel for the remainder of 2021 on the expectation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) keep supply discipline, even as Iran's exports may resume if the United States rejoins a nuclear agreement with Tehran.
"We have had those stock draws for a couple months, the market is heading in the right direction," Hardy told the FT Commodities Global Summit.
Trafigura Chief Executive Jeremy Weir told the same event there was a good chance prices could reach $100 a barrel because of falling reserves before the world reaches peak oil demand.
OPEC+ producers have been gradually relaxing record output curbs in recent months.
"The decision by OPEC+ to be overly cautious in returning supply to the market, whether this is true caution or they are intentionally stoking oil prices higher, has been a main tenant in seeing $73 per barrel Brent," said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy.
U.S. crude stocks fell by 8.5 million barrels in the week ended June 11, according to two market sources, citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.85 million barrels and distillate stocks climbed by 1.96 million barrels, the data showed, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. [API/S]
Official government data is due out Wednesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect U.S. crude stocks to have fallen for a fourth week in a row, dropping by about 3.3 million barrels last week. Industry data is due at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, followed by official figures on Wednesday morning. [EIA/S]
Investors and traders are also watching the outcome of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting that starts on Tuesday for signals on when it will start to scale back monetary stimulus.
The Fed is getting ready to debate how and when to start tapering a massive asset-purchase program that helped to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic.

Investing.com - U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week and fuel inventories like gasoline continue to build at a time when many continue to bet on a strong summer of demand for energy as international travel gathers steam.  
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for U.S. crude prices, was up 2.23% to $72.46 a barrel on the news, after settling up up 1.75% to $72.12 a barrel.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 8.5 million barrels for the week ended June 10, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute. That compared with a draw of 2.1 million barrels reported by the API for the previous week.
The API also showed that gasoline inventories rose by about 2.9 million last week, compared with a 2.4 million build in the prior week, and distillate stocks rose by about 2.0 million barrels.
The official government inventory report due Wednesday is expected to show weekly U.S. crude supplies declined by about 3.3 million barrels last week.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) is defending efforts to wipe clean government-backed loans to farmers facing decades of discrimination, despite a temporary restraining order on the debt relief plan issued by a U.S. District court last week.
A USDA spokesperson said the agency will be ready to process payments on an estimated $4 billion in debt relief for 17,000 Black, Indigenous, Hispanic and Asian farmers once legal battles are resolved. It planned to start the payments in June.
"USDA will continue to forcefully defend its ability to carry out this act of Congress and deliver debt relief to socially disadvantaged borrowers," a USDA spokesperson said on Tuesday.
The spokesperson said the government cannot appeal the restraining order, which pauses payments until the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin rules more broadly on a lawsuit over whether or not the debt relief program discriminates against non-minority farmers.
For decades, USDA employees and programs have discriminated against socially disadvantaged farmers by denying loans and delaying payments, resulting in $120 billion in lost farmland value since 1920, according to a 2018 Tufts University analysis. The Biden administration's loan forgiveness program is aimed at addressing those systemic inequities.
The lawsuit, filed by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on behalf of 12 white farmers, aims to halt the debt relief by claiming it excludes farmers on the basis of race. It is one of several lawsuits filed after the USDA detailed plans to implement the minority farmer debt-relief provision, which is part of the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in March.
Judge William C. Griesbach, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, granted the temporary restraining order on June 10.
"The obvious response to a government agency that claims it continues to discriminate against farmers because of their race or national origin is to direct it to stop," Griesbach said in the decision.
Some Black farmers are not surprised the relief has stalled, having seen previous government anti-discrimination efforts underdeliver.
"Talk is cheap. I can't buy grain with it. I want to know when you're going to help some farmers," said Lloyd Wright, a Virginia farmer who served as the director of the USDA's Office of Civil Rights in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Wright said Black farmers have been promised relief from federal discrimination in the past, only to be repeatedly disappointed. He suggests eligible farmers continue paying on loans, so they do not end up behind if the program is permanently blocked.

Investing.com - U.S. oil prices closed at their highest since 2018 on Tuesday ahead of the release of industry data that market bulls hope will show a decent drawdown in gasoline last week to match the hype of a rally driven by expectations more than real numbers of fuel demand.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark for U.S. oil, settled up $1.24, or 1.8%, at $72.12 per barrel. It earlier hit a session peak of  $72.28. Both that peak and Tuesday’s settlement were the highest since October 2018.
Brent crude, which acts as the global benchmark for oil, settled up $1.13, or 1.6%, at $73.99. Brent earlier rose to a session peak of $74.13,  the highest for a day since April 2019. 
Oil prices have been on a tear lately amid projections for one of the biggest ever summer demand periods for fuel in the U.S. as the country reopens fully from Covid-19 lockdowns.
The International Energy Agency, which represents the interests of Western oil consumers, said in its monthly report that global producers would need to boost output to meet demand set to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022.
Despite the optimism over global oil demand, U.S. gasoline take-up has been tepid since the May 31 Memorial Day that marked the start of the peak summer driving period in the world’s largest oil consuming country. That suggests to some that more time was probably needed for U.S. fuel demand to accelerate.
The problem was particularly highlighted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Petroleum Status Report for the week ended June 4, which showed a 7.05-million barrel build in gasoline inventories versus analysts’  expectations for a rise of just about 1.2 million barrels.
Tuesday’s rally in WTI and Brent came ahead of a weekly snapshot on U.S. oil supply-demand due from the API, or American Petroleum Institute.
The API snapshot, scheduled for release at 4:30 PM ET (20:30 GMT), comes before Wednesday’s update of the Petroleum Status Report by the EIA.
According to a consensus of analysts tracked by Investing.com, U.S. crude stockpiles likely fell by 3.3 million barrels last week, versus the drop of 5.2 million in the previous week to June 4.
Gasoline inventories likely rose by 614,000 barrels versus the rise of 7.05 million in the prior week, consensus shows.
And stockpiles of distillates, made up of diesel and heating oil, likely increased by 186,000 barrels last week after growing by 4.4 million the week before.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian economic growth has resumed after the COVID shock but is lagging the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, with food inflation, heightened insecurity and stalled reforms slowing growth and increasing poverty, the World Bank said on Tuesday.
Presenting its six-monthly update on development in Africa's most populous country, the organisation gave a GDP growth forecast for Nigeria of 1.9% in 2021 and 2.1% in 2022, compared with 3.4% this year and 4.0% next year for sub-Saharan Africa.
Lead economist for Nigeria Marco Hernandez said inflation, especially in food prices, was exacerbating poverty and food insecurity. Food accounted for almost 70% of Nigeria's total increase in inflation over the past year.
He said the COVID-induced crisis was expected to push over 11 million Nigerians into poverty by 2022, taking the total number of people classified as poor in the country to over 100 million. The total population is estimated at 200 million.
The World Bank expects the Nigerian inflation rate in 2021 to be 16.5%. The forecast for sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Nigeria, is 5.9%.
Hernandez said increased insecurity across the nation -- ranging from mass abductions at schools, kidnappings for ransom, armed conflict between herdsmen and farmers, armed robberies and various insurgencies -- was a drag on growth and job creation.
He said it was critical for the government to maintain reform momentum, but that some important reforms had stalled.
He cited petrol subsidies, which have recently returned after the government had established a market-based pricing mechanism, and electricity tariff reform, an area where planned adjustments to bring prices in line with costs have been paused.
Hernandez said Nigeria had the largest number of people without access to electricity in the world, and that electricity subsidies benefited mainly richer households. Only 22% of the poorest households have access to electricity, while 82% of the richest are able to access power.

metals products can comply with new legislation on and customer demand for clean conflictfree raw materials one of the main points fieldfisher presents in the guide is that enhanced supply chain scrutiny should not be about riskavoidance that is about dodging certain jurisdictions affected by conflict human rights abuses weak environmental standards and other challenging governance issues but rather about raising standards across the board in the firms view demand for ethically produced resources will help prevent supply chain abuse and enable mining companies operating to recognized best practice standards to compete on a level playing field in this sense the guide proposes a number of steps for miners and smelters to underpin their customers due diligence processes and promote transparency the first idea introduced is that of mapping a route to market which means that since nowadays very few mines get built without an offtaker first being lined up to buy a

operation is also an important step proposed in the guide this taking into account that while mining companies based in the uk and the eu are largely free from suspicion under the eu conflict minerals regulation mineral and metal supply chains can be lengthy and complex and unscrupulous operators can use this complexity to their advantage obscuring the source of the metal or mineral by inserting extra links with european countries aiming to become recognized suppliers of 3tg and potentially other minerals in future this increases the risk that these countries could be used to mask illegal or unethical sourcing activity the handbook reads transparency is key to better prepare for their customers demands and comply with increased regulation of supply chains fieldfisher also suggests that mining companies and processors establish one comprehensive set of questions and answers with supporting evidence so that they can share it with purchasing organizations and potential

climate activists target norway at human rights court the people vs arctic oil climate activists target norway at human rights court in oil companies news 16062021 norwegian climate activists have asked the european court of human rights echr to rule against norways plans for more oil drilling in the arctic the campaigners said on tuesday arguing the countrys exploration deprives young people of their future the lawsuit by six individuals aged between 20 and 27 as well as greenpeace and young friends of the earth is part of an emerging branch of law worldwide where plaintiffs go to court to make the case for curbing emissions that cause climate change in the netherlands a court recently ordered shell rdsa l to cut its emissions in a lawsuit brought by citizens who argued that the anglodutch oil major violated their human rights the environmentalists argue that by allowing new oil drilling in the midst of a climate crisis norway is in breach of fundamental human rights the campaigners said in a statement announcing their appeal to the echr the announcement came as equinor eqnr ol the oil firm majoritycontrolled by the government on tuesday announced it would speed up investments in renewable energy while also continuing to raise oil output for the next five years the norwegian oil and energy ministry declined to comment on the lawsuit three courts in norway have previously ruled in favour of the government however including in a verdict by the supreme court last december thus exhausting domestic legal options we have to take action now to limit irreversible damage to our climate and ecosystems to ensure livelihoods for the coming generations said ella marie haetta isaksen 23 one of the activists who asked the echr to take up the norwegian case lasse eriksen bjoern 24 an activist from the indigenous sami people of northern norway said climate change was already endangering a way of life the sami culture is closely related to the use of nature and fisheries are essential a threat to our oceans is a threat to our people he said the echrs rules require applicants to be directly and personally affected by alleged violations while its judgments are

global production limits crude oil price increases in the most recent forecast growing global production limits crude oil price increases in the most recent forecast in oil companies news 16062021 in the june shortterm energy outlook steo we forecast that rising global production of petroleum and other liquid fuels driven by opec russia and the united states will limit price increases for global crude oil benchmarks brent and west texas intermediate wti we forecast production will increase more rapidly than consumption ending the large global stock draws seen in the first two quarters of 2021 and limiting upward crude oil price movement at its june 1 meeting opec which includes opec members and several nonmember countries reaffirmed its commitment to continued production increases in the coming months we forecast opecs annual production to average 26 9 million barrels per day bd in 2021 and 28 7 million bd in 2022 we also forecast that production of petroleum and other liquids in russia an opec participant will increase and that annual production will average 10 7 million bd in 2021 and 11 5 million bd in 2022 source u s energy information administration shortterm energy outlook steo the price of wti crude oil increased from 52 per barrel b in january 2021 to 65b in may driving increases in the u s crude oil rig countan indicator of active u s crude oil production capacity that is compiled by baker hughes we expect the u s crude oildirected rig count will likely continue rising in response to the rising wti crude oil price we expect crude oil production in the united states will increase each quarter through the forecast period averaging 11 4 million bd in the fourth quarter of 2021 4q21 the highest level since 1q20 and 11 1 million bd for all of 2021 we expect u s crude oil production will average 11 8 million bd in 2022 source graph created by the u s energy information administration shortterm energy outlook steo and data from baker hughes company as accessed through bloomberg higher crude oil prices and planned opec production increases contribute to our forecast that global petroleum supply will increase over the next several months resulting in an essentially balanced market in the second half of 2021 we then expect petroleum inventories to build in 2022 as production outpaces consumption based on this global supply and demand forecast we expect the brent crude oil price will average 68b in 3q21 we expect the price to fall to 64b in 4q21 and decline further to average 60b in 2022 the extent to which countries adhere to the current opec production agreement and the volume of crude oil entering the market from iran could push prices higher or lower similarly if u s operators add fewer drilling rigs than expected the result would be lower u s crude oil production in 2022 which would also affect prices source eia seleccionar idioma con la tecnología de traductor de google share share guardar previous south koreas mfg buys about

lng industry sees a somewhat green hydrogen future australias lng industry sees a somewhat green hydrogen future in general energy news 16062021 having scaled the peak of becoming the worlds top exporter of liquefied natural gas lng australias producers of the superchilled fuel are contemplating switching their industry around to become the global leader in hydrogen the keynote sessions at the australian petroleum production and exploration associations appea conference on tuesday were full of how the industry can and should embrace the challenges of climate change and move to producing the energy that can be free of carbon emissions the strongest call came from kevin gallagher appeas chairman and chief executive of australias secondbiggest oil and gas producer santos sto ax who told the event that unless the industry decarbonised it would not be able to continue to develop its resources decarbonisation through technologies like carbon capture and storage and hydrogen production using natural gas is critical he told the conference currently hydrogen is the only obvious pathway to eliminating scope 1 2 and 3 emissions associated with gas production and consumption gallagher said referencing the terms used to refer to the emissions a company creates by producing and transporting its products and also the emissions from the end users gallaghers call isnt the first time switching to hydrogen has been touted as a solution to the emissions created by australias resources industry which is a major carbon producer given its leading lng role and its status as the worlds biggest exporter of coking coal used to make steel and secondbiggest in thermal coal used in power plants whats different this time is the industry is using its biggest event to talk about fundamental change and to effectively recognise that it will die out if it doesnt embrace a decarbonised future perhaps the lng industry has seen what is happening to coal and decided to act before it goes irretrievably down the same path if you went to a coal conference in asia a decade ago you would have found an industry confident in its future with the attitude that its product was cheaper than alternatives reliable and that climate change was really just hocus pocus fast forward to today and coalfired generation is under threat apart perhaps from in countries with vast domestic reserves such as china and india new mines are struggling to get approvals and funding and countries across asia are cancelling their coalfired building plans in favour of now cheaper renewables backed by power storage australias lng industry faces much of the same pressure that was brought to bear on coal namely difficulties in accessing capital and bank financing shareholder revolts over climate change policies and the threat of longerterm obsolescence in a carbonconstrained future hydrogen hopes hence the idea of switching to hydrogen a fuel that doesnt produce emissions when burnt but can produce substantial emissions in being produced depending how it is done the greenest way to produce hydrogen to is power the energyintensive production process using electricity generated entirely from renewable sources and some lng producers such as australias biggest oil and gas company woodside wpl ax are planning such ventures including a project in the island state of tasmania which predominantly uses hydropower to generate electricity however what australias lng industry is talking about is producing hydrogen from natural gas and the only way to make that with net zero emissions is to capture and store the emissions during production or to have carbon offsets in place from an engineering and skills perspective australias lng players are well placed to make the change there is also suitable geology such as stable depleted oil and gas reservoirs to store the carbon emissions in some ways the technical side of pivoting the lng industry into a hydrogen industry is the easy part the difficult part is going to be securing the billions of dollars needed of working with governments to ensure that hydrogen is actually the fuel of the future and negotiating with customers such as japan and south korea to ensure that they build or adapt their energy systems to use hydrogen at the same time as the producers switch there is a finite amount of investment dollars in energy and most are finding their way into renewables such as solar wind and battery storage getting those dollars back into natural gas to hydrogen wont be easy especially for an industry that spent about 200 billion in the last decade to make australia the worlds top lng producer and hasnt really rewarded shareholders for their investments the natural gas to emissionsfree hydrogen will only work if the process of storing the carbon attracts credits that can be bought and sold internationally something that means governments and regulators need to be involved in short the oil and gas industry has to win back its friends with money and get governments and customers onside while fighting off increasingly wellfunded environmentalists campaigning for the industry to be shut down sooner rather than

gas by charles kennedy jun 15 2021 330 pm cdt ohio may soon join a dozen u s states to have enacted legislation to preemptively block cities and counties from banning natural gas as a source of heating or cooking in new homes a committee at the ohio senate is expected to vote on tuesday on such legislation ohio capitaljournal reported the socalled house bill 201 if it makes the committee vote on tuesday could be headed for a full vote at the senate as early as this week ohio house passed the bill last month with 65 votes in favor and 32 against with all republicans and two democrats supporting it if the bill becomes law it would preemptively block cities and counties in the state of ohio from enacting a zoning or other law that limits prohibits or prevents customers including households and businesses from having a natural gas or propane service proponents and supporters of the ohio bill say that it keeps the right of the people and businesses to choose their choices of energy while bans on natural gas would force them to choose more costly appliances opponents of the bill for their part argue that such preemptive legislation cares for the need of the fossil fuel industry its clearly not a piece of legislation about whats best for ohio dan sawmiller ohio energy policy director at the national resources defense council nrdc told ohio capital journal in an interview its about whats best for the fossil fuel industry sawmiller added since the city of berkeley in california enacted in 2019 the first citywide ban on new natural gas hookups in residential buildings other major cities have followed some states however are not having it and have either introduced or already enacted into law preemption bills to prevent cities from natural gas bans according to nrdc as of june 1 preemption bills were introduced in 19 states this year 14 of which have been enacted into law or awaiting final signature from the states governor the 19 states are

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices soared Tuesday, hitting their highest levels in more than two years, as prospects dimmed of additional supply from Iran hitting the market in the near future.
By 9:05 AM ET (1305 GMT), U.S. crude was up 1.2% at $71.76 a barrel, its highest since September 2018, while Brent was up 1% at $73.60, its highest since October 2018.
U.S. Gasoline RBOB Futures were up 0.8% at $2.1885 a gallon.
Crude markets have posted gains of over 40% this year to date as ramped-up vaccinations programs allowed many western countries to cast off their Covid-19 restrictions, resulting in a recovery in the global economy.
The International Energy Agency predicted last week that global oil demand will recover to pre-pandemic levels late next year.
However, the possibility of Iran resuming crude exports in the event of the U.S. lifting sanctions as a result of the 2015 nuclear deal being revived has weighed on the overall market over the last few weeks as negotiations have progressed in Vienna.
Such a deal could potentially add up to the addition of 2 million barrels of crude a day to the global market.
It’s “looking increasingly unlikely that we will see the US re-join the Iranian nuclear deal before the Iranian Presidential Elections later this week,” said ING analysts, in a research note. “If talks drag on, there is the potential for a new government taking a different approach with the negotiations, which could possibly further delay any deal.” 
The front-runner in the Iranian election is Ebrahim Raisi, an implacable critic of the West who was sanctioned by the United States in 2019 for human rights violations.
Additionally, Iran said Tuesday that it has made 6.5 kg (14 lb) of uranium enriched to up to 60%, a further step toward nuclear weapons-grade of 90% and a move that is sure to add to the complications surrounding the negotiations.
Investors will also be keeping a wary eye on the two-day Federal Reserve meeting for clues as to when the central bank will start reining in its ultra-easy monetary policies, as well as the U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.

continues in yemen amid secret ceasefire talks u s natural gas production poised to soar colombia reboots oil industry despite deadly protests by matthew smith jun 15 2021 100 pm cdt trade oil futures and energy stocks after a devastating 2020 strifetorn colombia has been rocked by widespread antigovernment protests which were sparked at the end of april 2021 by president duques proposed tax reform authorities heavyhanded repression of the protests which sees 77 dead with 40 of those at the hands of police and security agencies according to think tank indepaz sparked a series of road blockades across colombia those have prevented onshore oil companies from resupplying their operations and transporting petroleum by road forcing many to shutter production the regions among the worst affected are the putumayo and middle magdalena valley basins forcing colombias fifthlargest oil producer gran tierra energy to shutin 5250 barrels of oil production this is because most of the drillers developed oil reserves and producing fields are in those two basins the overall impact of the protests and related blockades on colombias economically vital oil industry has been severe colombias energy minister diego mesa released data showing that national oil production fell below 700000 barrels per day during may 2021 the first time since 2009 when national oil output averaged 670526 barrels per day mesa went on to claim the blockades had forced up to 48000 barrels of daily oil production offline and cost the combined energy and mining sectors over 69 million regardless of those events mesa believes that colombia will still pump on average 780000 to 800000 barrels per day during 2021 although that is dependent on the blockades being lifted it is worth noting that the forecast is well above the daily average of 745305 barrels pumped for the first four months of the year meaning it likely will not be achieved unless there is a significant lift in production during the second half of 2021 despite signs that the antigovernment protests are easing boding well for colombias economically vital energy sector there is still considerable uncertainty the national strike committee

particularly important because colombias economy is dependent on hydrocarbon production to grow yet possesses very meager oil and natural gas reserves for 2020 which was an abnormal year due to the pandemic and oil price crash petroleum was still responsible for 17 of government income 3 of gdp and 28 of exports by value prior to the august 2014 oil price crash petroleum generated more than a fifth of colombias fiscal revenue 55 of exports by value and nearly 5 of gdp during 2013 the andean countrys gdp grew by an impressive 5 1 which was primarily due to growing oil production which for the first time ever broke through the million barrels per day mark to average 1008178 barrels daily those numbers underscore just how important the exploitation of hydrocarbons has become for colombias economy despite being a major oil producer in latin america the regions thirdlargest colombia does not possess significant crude oil reserves the oildependent countrys energy ministry stated earlier this month that by the end of 2020 colombia had proved oil reserves totaling 1 8 billion barrels an 11 decrease compared to a year earlier and 2 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas an almost 7 year over year decline those proved oil reserves will only last for just over six years at current production levels which are 16 lower than 2019 and nearly eight years for natural gas despite current output is 1 less than 2019 these numbers demonstrate that colombia urgently needs to make major hydrocarbon discoveries and rapidly expand its proved reserves if it is to avert an economic crisis unless that occurs or colombia rapidly reduces its economic dependence on oil production it is facing a nearterm economic crisis when those limited hydrocarbon reserves are drained that would

company chinese gasoline demand is driving oil prices higher by irina slav jun 15 2021 1131 am cdt it was strong demand for gasoline in china that drove the countrys crude oil demand higher bloomberg has reported citing estimates from cnpc and sinopec along with analysts gasoline demand in may the data showed was 5 percent higher than it was in the last prepandemic year diesel consumption on the other hand remained largely flat bloomberg said the data adds to already strong evidence that china is among the biggest swing factors in oil prices news about lower demand in china even if it is the result of seasonal refinery maintenance tends to send oil prices lower news about improving demand invariably pushes them higher crude oil import data from the worlds top importer has been particularly bullish for prices china has been buying oil like theres no tomorrow for months especially during the worst of the pandemic when prices tanked to multiyear lows as a result prices rose and they are still rising prompting doubts that the buying spree will continue the immediate outlook is not particularly bullish because of the refinery maintenance season as reuters columnist clyde russell reported last month some 1 2 million bpd in refining capacity went offline for regular maintenance in may and will remain offline until the end of this month this would mean lower crude oil imports during the period related the renewable energy revolution has a major employment problem indeed import data for may showed a 15percent drop from a year earlier this was expected and did not have a lasting effect on prices still rebounding demand elsewhere may dampen chinas thirst for crude as it pushes brent above 73 per barrel and west texas intermediate above 71 per barrel rising crude

to work together with other national and regional navies in the spirit of the yaoundé code of conduct this code is designed to improve operational readiness maritime domain awareness informationsharing practices and tactical interdiction expertise the us consul general claire pierangelo described maritime security especially in the gulf of guinea as a common interest to all nations adding that no fewer than 16 countries shared the same waters she stated that the annual sea exercise attested to the strong partnership between us and nigeria pointing out that executing it despite the covid19 restrictions was a true testament to the richness and quality of both countries relationship gambo said the sustenance of this exercise was critical to nigerias national interest given the huge contributions of the nations strategic maritime resources to national prosperity and development this is in line with the nigerian navy mandate and other treaties which nigeria is a signatory too he said the cns appreciated the government of the united states through the u s african command and other international partners for facilitating and sustaining exercise obangame express

the increasing wave of insecurity on west african waters and the urgent need for talks on maritime security in region has become an urgent task thankfully the second edition of international maritime defence exhibition and conference imdec provides opportunities for maritime operators and regulators to air their views experiences and exchange ideas on how to tackle the trade and economydisruptive activities by criminals across the region over 15 chiefs of navy chiefs of air staff and 300 international senior officials will be hosted by the ghanaian navy and air force on july 68 in ghana held in partnership with ghana navy and ghana air force the imdec will be graced by the participation of key government leaders including the vice president of ghana alhaji mahamudu bawumia maritime security in recent times has become a more important issue in west african region where attacks on ships and crew jumped at an alarming level last year especially despite the covid19 pandemic this is expected to top the agenda to be deliberated upon by the 15 chiefs of navies and air forces along with 300 senior officials attending the imdec organised by great minds event management a global strategic events management organisation that closely works with governments imdec will address key defence and maritime security issues showcase new technology for the defence sector where multimillion dollars worth of deals would be negotiated participating companies will be demonstrating their best products and services that could equip the naval and air forces and enhance their defence capabilities at sea the gulf of guinea is a vast and diverse region stretching from senegal to angola covering 6000 kilometres of coastline it is an important shipping zone transporting oil and gas as well as goods to and from central and southern africa around 1500 fishing vessels tankers and cargo ships navigate its waters at any given day piracy armed robbery at sea kidnapping of seafarers illegal fishing smuggling and trafficking and transnational organised crime pose a major threat to maritime security in the gulf of guinea and ultimately to the economic development of the entire region the gulf of guinea saw 84 attacks on ships with 135 seafarers kidnaped for ransom in 2020 according to the international maritime bureau nearly 50 per cent increase in kidnapping for ransom between 2018 and 2019 and around 10 per cent increase between 2019 and 2020 the region now accounts for just over 95 per cent of all kidnappings for ransom at sea the covid19 pandemic brought about increased economic hardship resulting in emboldened reliance on illicit yet lucrative activities according to a 2020 report published by africa risk compliance issued about piracy attacks revealed that a total of 147 vessels were attacked in 2020 the report stated some other alarming figures noting 149 members of the crew were kidnapped with 27 kidnapped for ransom in response regional armed forces are acquiring resources and combining capabilities to effectively address these threats at the 2nd imdec taking place in ghana the threeday conference and exhibition including exclusive site visit will see senior officials discuss and address how to continue tackling the issues of securing the increasingly volatile maritime threats facing africas territorial waters actual and attempted piracy attacks in the west african coast increased from 34 per cent to 79 in 2020 up from 59 in 2019 while total of 147 vessels were attacked in 2020 and 149 crew were kidnapped with 27 kidnapped for ransom expressing concerns over the spate of attacks on vessels on west african waterways and the timeliness of the coming conference the newlyappointed rear admiral issah adam yakubu chief of naval staff ghana navy said it is troubling to know that 95 per cent of all kidnappings at sea in 2020 occurred in the gulf of guinea regrettably the actual and attempted attacks in the region also increased by 34 per cent from the 2019 figure of 59 79 in the year 2020 despite the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all of us according to the rear admiral these statistics call for urgent and concerted efforts to deal with the menace stressing that is why i rear admiral issah adam yakub chief of the naval staff of ghana is inviting my colleague chiefs of navy and coastguards other law enforcement agencies experts industry and all other stakeholders in the maritime domain to meet in accra i am hopeful that by the end of this conference we can collectively find innovative ways to curb the rise of criminal activities in the gulf of guinea for the benefit of our nations and the people who trade and derive their livelihoods from the sea great minds event management and my team here in ghana will ensure strict adherence to all covid protocols to ensure the safety of all he concluded commenting on their participation in this edition ghanas chief of the air staff avm frank hanson said for several years the maritime space remains one of the most vital components of our national security and with a coastline of 550 kilometres and an exclusive economic zone of 200 miles ghanas maritime space accounts for more than 80 per cent of ghanas gdp and that impacts positively on our neighbours in the region the proximity of the gulf of guinea to europe and north america for the transportation of low oil further raises its importance in the global supply of energy as youre aware more than 5 4 million barrels of crude oil are produced from the gulf of guinea each year in recent years it has also become very clear that the force behind maritime security is air power certainly it is air power that is very smart flexible and responsible to provide reach for surface forces to dominate the maritime domain hanson enlightened he said it is therefore not surprising that the key highlights of imdec 2021 will feature for the first time the role of air power in maritime operations the strategic objectives of the ghana air force are to redefine the national maritime capability as an economic multiplier to national and subregional development this capability is to connect the maritime domain to strategic economic centers of our sub region i therefore wish to encourage our neighbours to take advantage of imdec 2021 the ghana air force works very closely with the ghana navy and other international partners to develop an integrated maritime and air operations to cover our territorial waters he said threatened by this growing insecurity at sea are tens of billions of dollars in investments on the west african maritime sector by 2020 the african port sector had collectively attracted 50 billion in public and private investments this has heralded an emergence of worldclass ports in africa spread out in morocco south africa and egypt tangier med port was ranked at position 35 in this years lloyds list report on the worlds busiest seaports rubbing shoulders with renowned ports from developed nations such as the uk and usa these investments offer massive business opportunities for contractors suppliers and technology providers who could get a slice of the defence and maritime spending by participating at the imdec in this second edition the regional naval chiefs will be discussing on the theme maritime security and trade the nexus between a secure maritime domain in a developed blue economy some of the companies that have confirmed participation at the event include paramount israel shipyards ltd israel aerospace industries mbda and airbus they will all be showcasing their latest technologies and services throughout the twoday exhibition similarly among the chiefs of naval staff and vips who confirmed their attendance as guests and speakers at imdec include rear admiral nguessan kouame chief of naval staff cote divoire navy vice admiral awwal zubairu gambo chief of naval staff nigeria navy rear admiral oumar wade chief of naval staff senegalese navy rear admiral jean mendoua chief of naval staff cameroon navy rear admiral carlos alfredo mandungal chief of naval staff guinea bissau navy rear admiral jeffrey s spivey vice commander u s sixth fleet royal navy rear admiral ben reynolds director of maritime headquarters u s naval forces europeafrica u s 6th fleet captain pedro santana commander of the coast guard cape verde captain philip juana commander sierra leone navy and dr dieng abdourahmane rtd col head regional security division ecowas commission increased security breach onshore have forced governments of african countries to focus on upgrading the ports and maritime infrastructure and security to combat incidents and strengthen the security of commodities food energy and other products that are crucial for the rest of the world port development received extensive consideration from governments with most of the 38 african nations with coastlines having a port development project in the pipeline or ongoing despite the pandemic most of these projects were still in operation although logistical support was hindered by the lockdowns in 2020 the largest maritime security exhibition and conference in west africa the threeday imdec conference and exhibition will feature exclusive tours of ghanas air and naval bases and will consist of indepth walkthroughs of the naval dockyard and air base as well as private vessel tours to further display the advanced capabilities of ghanas naval and air force fleet it will be recalled that nigerian navy increases security presence in the gulf of guinea with the inauguration of obangame 2021 this involved the deployment of deployed six ships two tugboats two helicopters and a nigerian air force atr42 aircraft by the nigerian navy toward addressing maritime challenges in the gulf of guinea the chief of the naval staff cns vice admiral awwal gambo announced the increase of security assets in the region during the inauguration of the 11th exercise obangame express 2021 gambo explained that the exercise was an annual multinational maritime exercise borne out of the need for the gulf of guinea navies to work together for regional maritime safety and security the inaugurated exercise was held onboard the nigerian navy ship nns thunder at the naval dockyard ltd in victoria island lagos flagging off the exercise onboard nns thunder recently at the naval dockyard limited victoria island lagos the chief of the naval staff vice admiral awwal gambo explained that the exercise was aimed at contributing to the freedom of navigation in the gulf of guinea by strengthening coordination in the fight against insecurity for socioeconomic activities among member states to thrive he informed that it would also enhance the collective capabilities of gulf of guinea and west african nations to counter seabased illicit activities according to him the exercise was introduced to foster togetherness of regional navies as a result of the huge resources and vast potential being continuously undermined by multifaceted domestic and cross border threats this challenges the dwindling prosperity of member states he said the cns said that the exercise would present an ample opportunity for the nigerian navy to work together with other national and regional navies in the spirit of the yaoundé code of conduct this code is

academic research institutes government labs and companies are now experimenting with electrification zero or lowcarbon fuels such as hydrogen natural gas ammonia and biofuels and alternative power sources such as fuel cells and solar wind and wave power each has its pros and cons why electrifying ships matters just as on land electrification is one key to cleaning up the industrys emissions it allows engines operating on fossil fuels to be either replaced by alternative power generation technologies or downsized and modified for lowemissions operation it also allows ships to connect to electric power while in port reducing their emissions from idling ship electrification and hybridisation are significant trends for both commercial and military vessels electrifying a ship means replacing its traditional mechanical systems with electrical ones some fleets have already electrified propulsion and cargo handling hybrid power systems on the other hand integrate different

recent news eu raises eur20 billion in inaugural 10year next home shipping news commodities report analysis oil energy world economy stock market news home oil energy oil companies news the commodities feed oil holds firm the commodities feed oil holds firm in oil companies news 15062021 energy the oil market finished little changed yesterday with ice brent eking out a small gain this is despite it looking increasingly unlikely that we will see the us rejoin the iranian nuclear deal before the iranian presidential elections later this week while iran has said that there is a broad agreement with the us on lifting sanctions there are still some issues that need to be resolved if talks drag on there is the potential for a new government taking a different approach with the negotiations which could possibly further delay any deal we are assuming that iranian supply increases from 2 4mmbblsd currently to 2 6mmbblsd over 3q21 and then to 3mmbblsd in 4q21 if talks do drag on into 2h21 this supply is at risk however it would mean that other opec members would have more room to increase output later this year additional supply from opec will be needed over the second half of this year with demand expected to continue its recovery one concern for the oil market is the lack of investment that we are seeing and the implications this will have on the oil balance several years out a good example of this is angola where production has been in decline for years now one might say that opec cuts are the reason for angolas declining output but production is below their agreed output levels under the deal for example in may angola produced around 1 12mmbblsd whilst under the deal they could have produced around 1 28mmbblsd so as we see opec easing output cuts it is safe to assume that angolan oil output is unlikely to increase if anything it will probably continue to trend lower the angolan government is expecting that their oil output will average 1 19mmbblsd in 2021 although even that might be a stretch with output averaging roughly 1 15mmbblsd over the first five months of the year finally the eia released its latest drilling productivity report yesterday which continued to show a decline in drilled but uncompleted wells ducs in the us with the number of ducs falling by 247 over may leaving them at their lowest level since september 2018 in fact since peaking in june 2020 ducs have declined by 2353 the decline in ducs is no surprise given the recovery that we have seen in the market and this drawdown has also helped to sustain us oil output to a certain extent agriculture the agri complex came under pressure yesterday with corn and soybeans leading the selloff and this follows an improvement in the weather forecast in the us noaa expects abovenormal rainfall and normal temperatures over the next 814 days there had been concerns over warmer and dry weather in the us and the impact this would have on the us crop these concerns were reflected in the usdas latest crop progress report which showed that 68 of the us corn crop is rated good to excellent compared to 72 the previous week and 71 for the same week last year for soybeans 62 of the crop is rated good to excellent compared to 67 last week and 72 at the same stage last year developments in the biofuels market have also weighed on corn and soybean prices with reports that the us government is discussing options to provide some relief to refiners on the biofuel blending mandate d6 rin prices in the us a key measure for ethanol blending costs for refiners have increased more than threefold to an average of us1 38 this year compared to an average of us0 43 in 2020 stronger corn and soybean prices along with uncertainty over the biofuel mandate for the year has pushed up blending costs for refiners any support measure if approved could result in weaker domestic corn and soybean demand in the short term source ing seleccionar idioma con la tecnología

gas in transition upstream faces pressure to cut emissions go green natural gas in transition upstream faces pressure to cut emissions go green in oil companies news 15062021 the transition to a lowcarbon energy future raises tough questions for the us upstream natural gas industry over its environmental impacts and what measures should be taken to mitigate them it also threatens to end nearly 20 years of growth in gas production in earnings calls investor presentations and at conferences the lowcarbon narrative has become a recurring theme among upstream companies and their investors as the energy transition grows in prominence in the 2020s and beyond that narrative promises to dramatically alter the shale gas producer business model throughout the early 2000s the stunning success of shale drilling was determined largely by institutional investors and politicians directing capital and tax incentives to the upstream sector those investments allowed us producers to nearly triple domestic output since the early 2000s to more than 90 bcfd currently as boardrooms and legislatures scrutinize the carbon costs of drilling their mandate for the 2020s is one of discipline and stewardship first and foremost lowcost maintenancelevel production will remain critical to the survival of individual producers beyond that though intensive carbontracking and emissions reductions will also become vital in the years ahead low prices narrow margins over the past decade the price of benchmark henry hub gas has averaged just 3 01mmbtu according to sp global platts data consistently low prices have long been the hallmark of shale drilling and will remain a major selling point for gas as a residentialcommercial and industrial fuel through 2030 the real inflationadjusted price of benchmark henry hub gas will average just 2 85mmbtu according to a forecast from sp global platts analytics through the decade that follows prices will likely rise by less than 45 cents in the us low prices and the high cost to overhaul or repurpose midstream and downstream infrastructure will make gas a fierce competitor to alternative fuels even in a lowcarbon world while the push toward renewable power will erode market share for gas in the generation sector the fuel is forecast to remain critical to both the residentialcommercial and industrial markets over the next 30 years for the upstream industry low prices will require further improvements in efficiency and costcontrol over the past 10 years low gas prices have rendered obsolete some of the most prolific earlyera shale basins such as the fayetteville in arkansas and the barnett in texas in the decades to come that trend will only accelerate as producers focus on a narrowing pool of profitable resources in a handful of plays these are likely to include the delaware and midland subbasins of the permian in texas and new mexico the bakken largely in north dakota the marcellus in appalachia and the haynesville in texas and louisiana as of firstquarter 2021 an average shale producer in the delaware basin currently the most profitable in north america sees an internal rate of return close to 34 based on a halfcycle posttax analysis across appalachia the average producer sees closer to 14 to 19 just enough to remain profitable in recent years average irrs in even the most prolific basins have at times dipped lower into the single digits sometime for months generally producers require a return of at least 10 to achieve breakeven making margins below that level unsustainable longer term according to platts analytics consolidation over the next decade thin margins and a growing focus of investors on profitability will likely narrow the field by way of bankruptcies mergers and acquisitions leaving only the most efficient standing in q1 2021 bankruptcies among us exploration and production companies totaled eight according to recent data published by haynes and boone it was the most for any firstquarter period since 2016 but still down from peak levels in q2 2020 when 18 eps filed and q3 when 17 bankruptcies were filed even for producers that have weathered the recent storms consolidation pressures in the 2020s are only likely to grow during a recent earnings call eqt president and ceo toby rice told analysts that scale will become increasingly critical to

than that he said youve got a lot of service providers that are running at call it 50 utilization and youve got multiple gathering infrastructures carbon costs cost efficiency and consolidation pressures are just half of the equation for eps though in the 2020s and beyond discerning investors and tighter regulations will demand environmental stewardship too for natural gas producers emissions detection tracking and certification at the wellhead and on gathering lines will become an indispensable routine component of environmental stewardship beyond that investors will look to eps for leadership in the adoption of low or zerocarbon business models and emissionscutting technologies this spring the us largest gas producer eqt already took its first step in that direction saying its marcellus output would undergo an independent assessment of its environmental impact its certification will include quantified assessments for methane detection and intensity along with an overall score based on other factors including the companys record on corporate governance ethics social impacts human rights community engagement biodiversity and climate change the push for greater environmental stewardship comes not just from investors but from enduser customers too earlier this year pavilion energy signed a sixyear lng sales and purchase agreement with chevron for the supply of some 500000 mtyear of lng to singapore starting in 2023 under the agreement cargoes delivered will be accompanied by a statement of ghg emissions measured from the wellhead to the discharge port at a recent climate summit chevrons general manager of esg and sustainability said he anticipates many future commercial deals will include such agreements for some companies the push to meet environmental goals will be met early on by aggressive emissions cuts last year bp for instance announced an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality across its global operation by midcentury for other eps the pressure has intensified just in recent weeks at exxonmobil which has announced its own plan to reduce ghg emissions some 30 by 2025 with reductions coming in part from carbon capture and sequestration technology an activist hedge fund managed to get three nominees on to the exxonmobil board the same day chevron investors voted for stringent targets to cut emissions from the companys products and royal dutch shell was handed a court decision in the netherlands ordering the company to accelerate emissions reductions and cut its carbon footprint 45 globally by 2030 environmental initiatives are already becoming businesscritical for eps as they look to attract both investor dollars and enduser customers the sector can expect more of the same into the mid2020s and

analysis and angus rodger director upstream research who led our analysis in mays horizons how they see the challenge upstreams a risky business whats the big deal the sheer range of possible outcomes in the transition a gradual transition could mean oil and gas demand in 2050 is not much different to today upstream would continue to do what it always has for a good few decades yet finding and developing new supply as well as generating a great deal of cash flow conversely upstreams role would change dramatically if the world pursues a 2degree or lower pathway our accelerated energy transition aet 2 c scenario envisages a world in 2050 in which oil demand is 70 lower than today and brent trades at us10 to us18bbl gas demand and prices are lower but more resilient than oil there will be much less need to invest in new oil supply and upstream would be more about managing decline is uncertainty affecting capital allocation upstream is going to get even more short term in its investment horizon spend is already at a 15year low and the focus is on shortcycle quickpayback projects few companies are prepared to finance big capitalintensive and longlife projects for fear that returns will be undermined by weakening demand and prices fewer still are drilling the highriskhighreward exploration wells that lead to big discoveries uncertainty related to the transition will accentuate these existing trends the repercussions could be felt sooner rather than later an extended period of low investment will increase the chances of a tighter oil market and higher prices later this decade should demand hold up will investment shift to gas its inevitable today oil still attracts almost 60 of upstream investment for one simple reason oil projects make more money gas projects tend to be more capitalintensive with longer paybacks which drags down returns however the world is going to need more gas so the industry must find a way to generate acceptable returns from big gas projects could upstream be more sustainable companies should be far more ambitious on scope 1 and 2 emissions upstream is the easiest part of the oil and gas value chain to decarbonise carbon pricing will help but the industry needs to stop thinking of decarbonisation as a cost centre most of the lowhanging fruit such as improved facility efficiency and reduced leakage and flaring can be valueaccretive developing lowcarbon assets including gas will lower portfolio carbon intensity carbon capture utilisation and storage ccusccs is a massive growth opportunity for upstream where it can leverage its technical expertise and existing infrastructure but success on an industrial scale will need the oil and gas industry to work in concert with big emitting onshore sectors and governments to develop integrated solutions will we need so many upstream companies consolidation is well underway already with three sizeable deals in the us l48 alone this year as oil and gas goes moves beyond growth this decade or beyond companies will look for economies of scale to bolster margins there are 2300 companies 1700 in the us lower 48 producing less than 15000 boed many of these will wither away from lack of finance another 250 companies iocs majors and private enterprises produce more than 30000 boed thats where the big consolidation opportunity lies how can business models change the industry has to adapt we will see some upstream companies specialise mature asset rejuvenation is one example private companies freer of esg constraints could have a competitive advantage bigger companies will look for ways to demonstrate value and access capital we will see imaginative solutions spinning off new energy or iocs aggregating regional or thematic portfolios as enibp announced in

home oil energy oil companies news upstreams biggest challenge upstreams biggest challenge in oil companies news 15062021 how can upstream plan and build for a profitable future with oil and gas demand so uncertain i asked fraser mckay head of upstream analysis and angus rodger director upstream research who led our analysis in mays horizons how they see the challenge upstreams a risky business whats the big deal the sheer range of possible outcomes in the transition a gradual transition could mean oil and gas demand in 2050 is not much different to today upstream would continue to do what it always has for a good few decades yet finding and developing new supply as well as generating a great deal of cash flow conversely upstreams role would change dramatically if the world pursues a 2degree or lower pathway our accelerated energy transition aet 2 c scenario envisages a world in 2050 in which oil demand is 70 lower than today and brent trades at us10 to us18bbl gas demand and prices are lower but more resilient than oil there will be much less need to invest in new oil supply and upstream would be more about managing decline is uncertainty affecting capital allocation upstream is going to get even more short term in its investment horizon spend is already at a 15year low and the focus is on shortcycle quickpayback projects few companies are prepared to finance big capitalintensive and longlife projects for fear that returns will be undermined by weakening demand and prices fewer still are drilling the highriskhighreward exploration wells that lead to big discoveries uncertainty related to the transition will accentuate these existing trends the repercussions could be felt sooner rather than later an extended period of low investment will increase the chances of a tighter oil market and higher prices later this decade should demand hold up will investment shift to gas its inevitable today oil still attracts almost 60 of upstream investment for one simple reason oil projects make more money gas projects tend to be more capitalintensive with longer paybacks which drags down returns however the world is going to need more gas so the industry must find a way to generate acceptable returns from big gas projects could upstream be more sustainable companies should be far more ambitious on scope 1 and 2 emissions upstream is the easiest part of the oil and gas value chain to decarbonise carbon pricing will help but the industry needs to stop thinking of decarbonisation as a cost centre most of the lowhanging fruit such as improved facility efficiency and reduced leakage and flaring can be valueaccretive developing lowcarbon assets including gas will lower portfolio carbon intensity carbon capture utilisation and storage ccusccs is a massive growth opportunity for upstream where it can leverage its technical expertise and existing infrastructure but success on an industrial scale will need the oil and gas industry to work in concert with big emitting onshore sectors and governments to develop integrated solutions will we need so many upstream companies consolidation is well underway already with three sizeable deals in the us l48 alone this year as oil and gas goes moves beyond growth this decade or beyond companies will look for economies of scale to bolster margins there are 2300 companies 1700 in the us lower 48 producing less than 15000 boed many of these will wither away from lack of finance another 250 companies iocs majors and private enterprises produce more than 30000 boed thats where the big consolidation opportunity lies how can business models change the industry has to adapt we will see some upstream companies specialise mature asset rejuvenation is one example private
