BOGOTA (Reuters) - Anti-government protests in Colombia were sparsely attended on Wednesday, but the economic fall-out of the six-week-old demonstrations is far from over, officials said.
Road blockades associated with protests have caused shortages throughout the country, interrupted exports, and hit oil and mining production.
Marches on Wednesday were largely concentrated in the capital, after union and student leaders called for protesters to "take over Bogota." Groups of hundreds gathered at several points around the city.
Talks between protest leaders and the government were suspended https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-president-announces-policing-changes-amid-brutality-accusations-2021-06-06 over the weekend over discord about a pre-agreement and the blockades.
The national strike committee, made up of unions and other groups, will adopt a new tactic for marches, union leader Francisco Maltes said, adding that the details would be announced on Thursday.
The government estimates blockades and protests have cost the economy some 11 trillion pesos, equivalent to more than $3 billion.
Many protesters have vowed to keep marching until the government makes changes to economic and social policies and tackles alleged police brutality.
Exports have been interrupted by barricades at the principal Pacific port in Buenaventura, where some 378,000 tonnes of corn and other grains are stuck, according to the agriculture ministry.
Around 1.8 million jobs connected to agriculture are at risk, Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Zea said in a Wednesday statement.
"The losses we've had in exportable products are worrying and have especially affected coffee, bananas, avocados, tilapia and sugar," he said.
At least two international buyers have suspended use of Colombian coffee because of delayed or unfulfilled shipments, the coffee federation said this week. Coffee exports fell 52% in May.
The effect of the blockade and resulting shortages was visible in the May inflation figure of 1%, well above market expectations. That sent 12-month consumer prices up 3.30%, above the central bank's 3% target.
Analysts say protests could damage Colombia's post-pandemic economic recovery after strong 1.1% growth in the first quarter. In April, the government estimated expansion could reach 5% this year.
Blockades have stopped the production of some 1.5 million barrels of crude oil and 2.7 billion cubic feet of gas, Mines and Energy Minister Diego Mesa said at a virtual conference on Wednesday.
"It's as if we stopped all the oilfields in the country for close to two days," said Mesa, who told Reuters this week he expects oil output to remain around 780,000-800,000 barrels per day this year.
Major coal miner Cerrejon recently halted production because of two blockades, but restarted rail transport on Friday.
The government says 21 people have died in connection with the protests, though advocacy groups say the toll is much higher. More than 2,300 people - civilians and security forces - have been injured, the defense ministry says.
Of 3,107 blockades which have taken place during protests, 28 were still active over the weekend, the ministry said.

By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday tapped his finance minister to run the central bank and picked a close ally to lead the finance ministry to help realize his vision of a fairer economy during the final half of his term.
Lopez Obrador said on Twitter that Finance Minister Arturo Herrera would take over from Bank of Mexico chief Alejandro Diaz de Leon, whose term concludes at the end of 2021.
To replace Herrera, Lopez Obrador chose economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O, who will be the third finance minister since the president took office in December 2018.
Ramirez faces a challenge reinvigorating the economy after two tough years for Lopez Obrador, whose efforts to strengthen state control of sectors like energy were sapping business investment even before the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, lifted by massive U.S. stimulus spending, the economy is expected to rebound strongly this year as the president approaches the halfway mark of his single six-year term.
In a video published in social media to flag the changes, Lopez Obrador vowed to boost social spending, while Ramirez said he would uphold budgetary discipline and prioritize Mexico's poor.
"We'll continue behaving responsibly, without getting the country into debt, without spending more than we take in, with honesty and austerity," Lopez Obrador said.
Ramirez, educated at the National Autonomy University of Mexico and Cambridge University, is a longstanding adviser to Lopez Obrador and was his pick for finance minister when he first ran for the presidency in 2006, an election he narrowly lost.
Herrera said he would stand down around mid-July, and pledged to uphold the central bank's independence. It has defended itself recently against congressional efforts to amend its functions and criticism from Lopez Obrador.
"It's very clear what role I'll be taking on if the Senate ratifies me, and the importance of defending the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico, and I think the president understands that," Herrera said during an interview on Mexican radio.
Jorge Gordillo, an economist at CI Banco, said Herrera's nomination was good news as he had an established track record.
"Herrera's viewed as a technical person. He knows the markets; he's respected," he said. "But we don't know how much Herrera will be the president's man at the Bank of Mexico."
Luis Gonzali, co-director at Franklin Templeton Investments in Mexico, said Herrera would probably show more independence in the bank than he had at the ministry. He noted that other Lopez Obrador nominees to Banxico's board had not bowed to his will.
Diaz de Leon was appointed to head the central bank under the previous government. Lopez Obrador, who regularly excoriates his predecessor, made plain that he saw those ties as a problem, and vowed to pick a successor who supported "moral economics".
Herrera, a former World Bank executive, took the job of finance minister in July 2019 when his predecessor quit after becoming frustrated by the drift of policy.
Under Lopez Obrador's auspices, Herrera ran tight budgets as minister and managed to maintain a relatively strong tax take during a prolonged phase of weak economic growth.
Mexico's economy slipped into a mild recession during Lopez Obrador's first full year in office, and suffered a slump of 8.5% during 2020 when the pandemic took hold.
While trying to prop up the economy, Herrera has grappled with trying to help loss-making and heavily indebted state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). Lopez Obrador has made reviving Pemex a top priority.
To improve the firm's efficiency, Ramirez is known to be a proponent of simplifying the corporate structure of Pemex, which over time has been carved into several companies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday urged the United States and European Union to quickly resolve their disputes over steel and aluminum tariffs and aircraft subsidies, and adopt a new privacy shield to better coordinate digital policy.
The largest U.S. business lobbying group mapped out its recommendations in a four-page memorandum sent to U.S. officials as President Joe Biden began his first trip abroad, an eight-day mission to rebuild trans-Atlantic ties strained during the Trump era and to reframe relations with Russia.
U.S. and EU officials are expected to launch a new trade and technology council during the summit that will set compatible standards and facilitate trade in fields such as artificial intelligence and data flows, according to U.S. and EU sources.
In its memo, which was seen by Reuters, the Chamber said Biden's June 15 summit with EU leaders was the right occasion to launch such a platform and align on clear shared priorities.
Doing so, it said, could help advance economic recovery "by eliminating existing barriers to transatlantic commerce, preventing new barriers, and establishing joint approaches on foundational and emerging technologies."
Closer cooperation would allow the two sides to craft more coordinated and effective responses to "countries that do not respect global trade rules and norms and pose significant threats to our security and values," an apparent reference to Russia and China.
EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters on Wednesday that Brussels hoped the visit would help bring a rapid end to trade disputes and foster better ties.
U.S. and EU officials will commit to ending the nearly 17-year dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co before July 11, while setting a Dec. 1 deadline to end punitive tariffs related to a steel and aluminum trade dispute, according to a draft communique.
The Chamber said both sides should also agree to a new U.S.-EU privacy shield to facilitate better coordination on digital policies, a vital step needed to "give companies the legal certainty they need when transferring data across the Atlantic."
The two sides should also agree to a "first, do no harm" principle on new regulations and new preferential trade agreements with third countries, the Chamber said.
It said the new council should have twice-yearly meetings at the senior level, with a formal mechanism to allow for structured business input.
The goal, it said, should be to strengthen bilateral relations, boost competitiveness and innovation, and meaningfully address shared concerns with third countries.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices were steady on Wednesday after U.S. inventory data showed a surge in gasoline inventories due to weak fuel demand following U.S. Memorial Day weekend, traditionally the beginning of the peak summer driving season.
Brent crude futures remained unchanged to settle at $72.22 a barrel, having earlier touched $72.83, their highest since May 20, 2019.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude closed 9 cents, or 0.1%, lower at $69.96 a barrel, after reaching $70.62, its highest since Oct. 17, 2018.
Despite a 5 million-barrel draw in crude oil last week, stocks of gasoline and other fuels rose sharply due to weak demand, according to Energy Information Administration data for the week that included the long Memorial Day holiday weekend. Product supplied fell to 17.7 million barrels per day, versus 19.1 million the week before.
"This could be canary in a coal mine at peak economic activity having occurred, but it's early days to conclude that," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
Other analysts noted, however, that the poor weather up and down the U.S. East Coast may have reduced consumption, following a period of gasoline hoarding that artificially boosted demand during the Colonial Pipeline outage last month from a ransomware attack.
On Tuesday, the EIA forecast U.S. fuel consumption would grow by 1.48 million bpd this year, up from a previous forecast of 1.39 million bpd.
Oil rallied earlier in the session on signs of strong fuel demand in western economies, while the prospect of Iranian supplies returning faded after the U.S. Secretary of State said sanctions against Tehran were unlikely to be lifted.
Investors had assumed that sanctions against Iranian exports would be lifted and oil supply would increase this year as Iran's talks with western powers on a nuclear deal progressed.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that even if Iran and the United States returned to compliance with a nuclear deal, hundreds of U.S. sanctions on Tehran would remain in place.

(Adds Brent settlement, comment on OPEC+)
By Barani Krishnan
Investing.com - U.S. oil prices hit their highest since 2018 before sliding on Wednesday as the government reported a mammoth weekly build in gasoline and diesel stockpiles amid a ramp-up in output by refiners anticipating runaway demand for fuels this summer.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark for U.S. oil, settled down 9 cents, or 0.1%, at $69.96 per barrel after racing earlier to $70.63, its highest since October 2018. WTI has gained 5.6% since the start of June.
Brent crude, which acts as the global benchmark for oil, settled flat at $72.12. Brent hit $72.85 earlier in the session, its highest since May 2019. It has gained 4% since the start of June.
Gasoline inventories rose by 7.05 million barrels during the week ended June 4, the Energy Information Administration said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had forecast a build of just 1.2 million barrels.
Stockpiles of distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 4.4 million barrels against expectations for a 1.8 million barrel rise.
Crude stockpiles fell sharply too, by 5.2 million barrels versus forecasts for a 3.5 million-barrel decline. But that was only because of the ramp up in fuel production due to a spike in refining activity.
The EIA said refinery runs rose by 2.6 percentage points to 91.3% last week, the first time they had run above the key 90% threshold for months. Clearing that bar was somewhat a vindication for oil bulls betting on upcoming demand for fuels in the summer months.
Analysts have projected one of the biggest ever summer demand periods for fuel in the U.S. as the economy reopens fully from a year of lockdowns and safety measures imposed after the March 2020 outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
“Refineries are running flat out to build inventories ahead of summer driving season,” economist Adam Button said in a post on ForexLive. “There is already talk of heavy traffic on the roads.”
Sophie Griffiths, head of UK and EMEA research for online broker OANDA, said WTI and Brent appeared poised for more gains in the coming weeks after OPEC+’s apparent success in getting the market to accept a hike in production through July. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also provided more support to the market by saying hundreds of Treasury Department sanctions were expected to remain on Iranian oil even if Tehran managed to strike a new nuclear deal with world powers to legitimately put its crude exports back on the world market. 
The oil rally had been somewhat held back in recent weeks by concerns that Iran could put some 2 million additional barrels on the market in the course of the next few months. 
“The ducks have lined up nicely for the oil market right now,” Griffiths said. “With no OPEC meeting due until early July, (WTI) oil could well target $72 in the coming weeks.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday announced its intent to protect more U.S. waterways through environmental regulations, reversing a Trump-era rollback that had been urged by farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army reviewed ex-President Donald Trump's Navigable Waters (NYSE:WAT) Protection Rule and determined that it "significantly" reduced clean water protections - a major concern as arid states in the west face droughts.
“After reviewing the Navigable Waters Protection Rule as directed by President Biden, the EPA and Department of the Army have determined that this rule is leading to significant environmental degradation,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a press release.
He said EPA and the Army will work on a broader, "durable definition" of which waters of the United States can be protected based on Supreme Court precedent and other cases so that it can withstand future legal challenges.
The agencies will also start a new rulemaking process that restores protections put in place before 2015.
In their review of the Trump rule, the agencies found that in New Mexico and Arizona, nearly all of the more than 1,500 streams assessed were unprotected, and 333 projects that would have otherwise required federal permitting no longer did.
Farmers, ranchers and big industrial companies supported the Trump rollbacks, saying previous definitions of which waterways should be protected were overly broad, in some cases covering streams that were completely dry.
Trump's rollback excluded seasonal streams and wetlands.
Some 14 states, including New York and California, had sued the Trump EPA over the rollback because they said it would end federal protection for half of the nation’s wetlands and 15% of streams across the country.
Environmental groups supported broadening waterway protections, but some urged quicker action.
“We are urging the EPA to swiftly extend full clean Water Act protections to all the nation’s waters,” said Julian Gonzalez, legislative counsel for healthy communities at environmental group Earthjustice.

By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The recent overhaul of Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s board of directors could shift billions of dollars in spending and strategy over several years, but any changes likely will take time, analysts and investors say.
A quarter of directors last month lost their seats to outsiders, and the March appointment of activist Jeff Ubben puts a third of the 12-member board in new and more cost-conscious hands. Investors who rejected Exxon's view of a slow transition to lower-carbon fuels also want spending to be revisited, they said.
The Exxon boardroom contest shocked the energy industry and came after years of weak financial returns at the largest U.S. oil producer. Shares are up by about 50% this year as oil prices have recovered from pandemic lows.
Exxon's board has been a prestige post for former CEOs, typically without any energy experience. Critics said the practice led Exxon to miss industry shifts and play catch-up at the expense of its balance sheet. Exxon bought in to natural gas near its peak, leading it to reduce the value of properties in the United States, Canada and Argentina by more than $19 billion last year, and paid up to arrive late to the shale oil party.
New directors with energy experience likely will address Exxon's spending “far more vigorously,” said Anne Simpson, investment director at shareholder California Public Employees' Retirement System.
Investors want a "fundamental rethink on strategy," she said, with “the big measure" being its $16 billion-$19 billion annual project spending. The shakeup puts in play billions of dollars in shale, liquefied natural gas, refining and chemical projects.
Asked to comment on its new board and strategy, Exxon said only that it welcomed the new directors. "We look forward to working with them collectively to benefit all of our shareholders."
STRATEGY REVIEW
Exxon needs "a real review of its strategy" in the wake of last month's International Energy Agency report that challenges the need for new projects if the world wants to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century, said Bess Joffe, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England.
"The board is going to have to adapt" by giving investors more information on projects and environmental, social, and governance issues, or ESG, said David Larcker, director of the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business.
"It's just not a company that can turn on a dime," Larcker cautioned, adding that this year's budget is set. It is midway into big outlays in Guyana, Brazil, U.S. shale and chemicals, analysts said.
Existing directors believe coupling oil and gas investment with a gradual shift to alternative energy is Exxon's best path forward, long-time director Ursula Burns said at a virtual event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas last week.
Exxon failed to communicate the importance of that phase-in to investors, she said.
"It has not been well done by Exxon Mobil for sure and that's one of the things that we have to work on is how do we tell the story," said Burns, who has served in many roles including as former chairman and CEO of Xerox Corp (NYSE:XRX).
She said Exxon did not pay attention early enough to public frustration over global warming and ESG. Investors, she said, "wanted a direct, in some cases, (and) in some ways, an impossible message to be given." Burns added that "most of the board" thinks an energy transition is needed and that companies like Exxon need to be engaged in how that happens.
LOCKED-IN PROJECTS
Energy analysts do not see Exxon slashing its biggest ventures - offshore oil in Guyana and Brazil, or liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia and the United States - due to long-term commitments. It already has cut spending in the United States and could lower further, they said.
Guyana and Brazil's offshore fields will be prioritized, said Ruaraidh Montgomery at researcher Welligence. LNG projects that supplant oil production also can help Exxon reduce emissions, said Tom Ellacott, at consultants Wood Mackenzie.
In the United States, Exxon has sharply cut drilling and reduced its shale output goals to 700,000 barrels per day from 1 million. But even there, Exxon's multi-year projects "are hard to undo," said Peter McNally, an analyst with investment research firm Third Bridge Group.
However, investors are not buying the poor-messaging explanation or belief that spending decisions cannot be revisited.
"This is a call to reassess fundamentals of supply and demand for energy in the long term, and to question whether Exxon's current thinking around renewables gaining market share is too modest," said Stewart Glickman, analyst at CFRA Research, in a client note.
